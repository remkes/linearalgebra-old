    <title>Determinants and Composition</title>
    <p>
      Algebra considers sets with structre. On the sets <m>M_n(\RR)</m>
      of <m>n \times n</m> matrices, the determinant is a new algebraic
      structre. We would like to investigate how it interacts with
      existing structures, starting with matrix multiplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      To compose two transformations, we multiply the matrices. In this
      composition, the effects on size should compound. If the first
      transformation doubles size and the second triples it, the
      composition should multiply size by a factor of <m>6</m>.
      Similarly with orientation: if both preserve orientation, the
      composition should as well. If both reverse orientation,
      reversing twice should return us to the normal orientation. So,
      two positive or two negatives should result in a positive, and one
      positive and one negative should result in a negative.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two <m>n \times n</m> matrices.
          Then <m>\det (AB) = \det (A) \det (B)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>A</m> is an invertible <m>n \times n</m> matrix, then
          <m>\det A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det A}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      In particular, <m>A</m> invertible means that <m>\det A</m> must
      be non-zero. For <m>A</m> to be invertible, it must have a
      non-zero determinant. It turns out this property is sufficient as
      well as necessary. A non-zero determinant preserves the
      dimension: it may increase or decrease size but it doesn't
      entirely destroy it. Therefore, there is always a way to go back,
      to reverse the process.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is invertible if and only
          if <m>\det A \neq 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      We can make a list of criteria for invertibility, including this
      new determinant condition.

      Here are two more properties of determinants.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be <m>n \times n</m> matrices and
          let <m>\alpha \in \RR</m> be a scalar.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \det (AB) \amp  = \det (BA)
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \det \alpha A \amp  = \alpha^n \det A
            </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      Row reduction is an important operations on matrices. It is
      convenient to know how the determinant changes under row
      operations.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a <m>n \times n</m> matrix. If we exchange
          two rows of <m>A</m>, the determinant changes sign (positive
          to negative, negative to positive). If we multiply a row by a
          constant <m>\alpha</m>, the determinant is multiplied by the
          same constant <m>\alpha</m>. If we add a multiple of one row
          to another, the determinant is unchanged.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      This last property is perhaps surprising: adding one row to
      another, even with a multiple, doesn't change the determinant.
      This also gives us another algorithm for calculating determinants:
      we can row reduce the matrix to a triangular matrix and calculate
      the determinant of the triangular matrix by multiplying the
      diagonal elements. If we kept track of the multiplication by
      constants and the row exchanges, we can use these rules to
      calculate the determinant of the original matrix.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the properties of determinant listed so far have been
      multiplicative. The situation for matrix addition and
      determinants is less elegant: <m>\det (A + B)</m> has no pleasant
      identity. This is an interesting contrast from many of the thing
      in this course: determinants are not linear functions <m>M_n(\RR)
      \rightarrow \RR</m> since they do not act nicely with addition.
      Instead, they act nicely with multiplication. On sets with
      various algebraic structure, it is common for an operation to
      interact well with one structure but poorly with the others.
