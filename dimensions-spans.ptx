      Let me remind you of a definition from <xref
      ref="section-row-reduction" /> since it will be useful in this
      section.

          Let <m>A</m> be an <m>m \times n</m> matrix. The
          <term>rank</term> of <m>A</m> is the number of leading ones
          in its reduced row-echelon form.

    <p>
      I can now present techniques to solve the dimension
      problems presented in <xref ref="section-spans" /> and <xref
      ref="section-loci" />.  For loci and spans, we
      didn't have a way of determining what information was redundant.
      Row-reduction of matrices solves this problem for us. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Given some vectors <m>\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k\}</m>, what is the
      dimension of <m>\Span \{ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k\}</m>?  By
      definition, it is the number of linearly independent vectors in
      the set. Now we can test for linearly independent vectors.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k\}</m> be a set of vectors in
          <m>\RR^n</m>. If we make these vectors the rows of a matrix
          <m>A</m>, then the rank of the matrix <m>A</m> is the number
          of linearly independent vectors in the set. Moreover, if we
          do the row reduction without exchanging rows (which is
          always possible), then the vectors which correspond to rows
          with leading ones in the reduced row-echelon will form a
          maximal linearly independent set, i.e., a basis. Any vector
          corresponding to a row without a leading one is a redundant
          vector in the span. The set is linearly independent if and
          only if the rank of <m>A</m> is <m>k</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the dimension of this span.
          <me>
            \Span \left\{ 
            \begin{pmatrix}
              5 \\ -1 \\ 0 
            \end{pmatrix},
            \begin{pmatrix}
              -2 \\ 6 \\ 1 
            \end{pmatrix},
            \begin{pmatrix}
              3 \\ 4 \\ 1
            \end{pmatrix}
            \right\}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the dimensions of the span, we put the vectors of the
          span into a matrix (as rows, not columns). 
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix}
              5 \amp -1 \amp 0 \\
              -2 \amp 6 \amp 1 \\
              3 \amp 4 \amp 1
            \end{pmatrix} 
          </me>
          This row reduces to the following matrix.
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 
            \end{pmatrix} 
          </me>
          Since there are three leading ones, all three vectors are
          linearly independent. The rank of the matrix is three, and
          the dimension of the span is three.

          There are only two leading ones, so only two of the original
          vectors were linearly independent. The rank is two and the
          dimension of the span is two.

          There are three leading ones, so only three of the original
          six vectors are linearly independent. The rank of the matrix
          is three and the dimension of the span is three.
