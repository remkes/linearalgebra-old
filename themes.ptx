  <title>Themes of the Course</title>
  <dl>
    <li>
      <title>Algebra</title>
      <p>
        Linear <em>algebra</em> is, as expected, an algebra course. (It
        is the only strictly algebra course taught at King's, though
        in a school with a larger mathematics program, it would be the
        first of a sequence of algebra courses.)
     </p>
      <p>
        The word <sq>algebra</sq> does not mean the same thing in
        university mathematics as it did in high-school mathematics.
        Previously, the word <sq>algebra</sq> usually signalled the use
        of variables: <m>3+5 = 8</m> is arithmetic, but <m>3 + x = 8
        \implies x = 5</m> is algebra. From that point, algebra became
        the manipulation of equations (and inequalities) with variables,
        particularly focusing on solving polynomials and rational
        functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In academic mathematics, algebra has a much broader and deeper
        sense. It is a whole branch of mathematics, with many
        subdisciplines: linear algebra, abstract algebra, homological
        algebra, etc. To build a concept of what I mean by the term
        <sq>algebra</sq> is a central goal of the course. I'll
        give a definition right now, at the start, but it's a difficult
        definition to understand; hopefully, the course will provide the
        necessary elaboration.
      </p>
      <definition>
        <statement>
          <p>
            <term>Algebra</term> is the study of sets with structure.
            It investigates possible structures on sets, the rules
            obeyed by those structures, and the interaction of various
            structures. (This definition is a little vague, since not
            all structures on sets are <term>algebraic</term>
            structures, but it will suit the purposes of this course.)
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
    </li> 
    <li>
      <title>Abstraction</title>
      <p>
        The definition of algebra just stated is an immensely abstract
        definition. I haven't specified what sets or what structures
        I'm talking about. (As noted in paranthesis in the definition,
        I could say that the course looks at algebraic structures, but
        that doesn't actually add any insight; it just delays the
        question.) The definition is very broad and  applies to a huge
        variety of sets and structures. Abstraction is built into the
        very nature of algebra.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the calculus courses, I often motivate the material by its
        applications. (The two most often used motivations are the
        Newtonian physics and percentage growth in ecology or finance.)
        In this sense, I'm treating the calculus as applied mathematics:
        mathematics driven by and designed for the solving of certain
        extra-mathematical problems. This is a reasonable approach for
        calculus, both for historical and pedagogical reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this course, there will be points where I emphasize the
        practical applications of linear algebra, of which there are
        many. However, my primary motivation for the course will be
        intrinsic and abstract: I want to study sets and their structure
        simply for the mathematical joy of it. This is the one course
        at King's which is most suited to presenting the goals and ideas
        of abstract mathematics, in and of themselves.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>Geometry</title>
      <p>
        Though the subject is called <sq>algebra,</sq> linear algebra is
        a very geometric discipline, and my approach to this course will
        emphasize the geometry. I will start with vectors, a geometric
        topic (though with rich algebraic structure). Throughout the
        course, I will play geometry and algebra against each other and
        use each to understand the other better. This interplay drives
        the discpline. In many ways, this will be a geomety course
        hiding under the title of an algebra course.
      </p>
      <p>
        In geometry, I will not restrict my attention to the
        conventional two and three dimensional geometry. The
        definitions of this course are very general, so I will try to
        do geometry in any (finite) dimension. A major challenge of
        the course is going from familiar, visible three dimensions to
        un-visualizable higher-dimensional geometry.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>Flatness</title>
      <p>
        While a geometry course, the geometry I will be presenting
        will be very restricted. The <sq>linear</sq> in linear algebra
        refers to lines, so I will start with the geometry of lines.
        However, the important property of a line, in this context, is
        the fact that it is straight: it doesn't curve. Linear algebra
        is the geomtery of straight or flat things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, curved, bent and broken objects are off-limits. I
        will investigate the geometry of flat objects: points, lines,
        planes and higher-dimensional analogues. A great advantage of
        this restriction is that flat things are very
        accessable. The geometry of curved objects is an immensely
        complicated and difficult subject. By restricting to flat
        objects, the mathematical tools and constructions become much
        more accessible.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>Symmetry</title>
      <p>
        Other than flatness, the other major geometric theme is
        symmetry. Many of the definitions and propositions produced in
        this course can be stated in terms of some kind of symmetry.
        Speaking broadly, I want to think of symmetry as preservation:
        the symmetry of a shape is some kind of operation which keeps
        the shape intact, preserves it. Throughout linear algebra, I
        will be talking about the preservation of various kinds of
        shapes and flat objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the interplay between algebra and geometry mentioned above,
        I will also translate this idea of symmetry back to algebra to
        give a understanding of algebraic symmetry.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>Proof</title>
      <p>
        Proofs are another major difference between the grade-school
        understanding of algebra and the academic sense of the word.
        Algebra is originally introduced to solve problems involving
        unknown quantities, usually by solving equations. Algebra is a
        problem-solving technique. In academic mathematics,
        mathematicians are usually more concerned with conjectures
        about mathematical objects and the proofs of those
        conjectures. In this course, I'll introduce the idea of
        conjectures, propositions, theorems and proofs. I'll ask for a
        small amount of proving on the assignments to build a flavour
        for proof-based mathematics.
