    <title>Determinants and Composition</title>
    <p>
      Algebra considers sets with structure. On the sets <m>M_n(\RR)</m>
      of <m>n \times n</m> matrices, the determinant is a new algebraic
      structure. I would like to investigate how it interacts with
      existing structures, starting with matrix multiplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      To compose two transformations, I multiply the matrices. In this
      composition, the effects on size should compound. If the first
      transformation doubles size and the second triples it, the
      composition should multiply the size by a factor of <m>6</m>.
      Similarly, with orientation: if both preserve orientation, the
      composition should as well. If both reverse orientation,
      reversing twice should return us to the normal orientation. So,
      two positive or two negatives should result in a positive, and one
      positive and one negative should result in a negative. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two <m>n \times n</m> matrices.
          Then <m>\det (AB) = \det (A) \det (B)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>A</m> is an invertible <m>n \times n</m> matrix, then
          <m>\det A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det A}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>A</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix, then
          <m>\det A^{T} = \det A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      In particular, for <m>A</m> to be invertible, it must have a
      non-zero determinant. It turns out this property is sufficient
      as well as necessary. A non-zero determinant preserves the
      dimension: it may increase or decrease size, but it doesn't
      entirely destroy it. Therefore, there is always a way to go back
      and to reverse the process.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is invertible if and only
          if <m>\det A \neq 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      I can expand the list of criteria for invertibility by including
      this new determinant condition. I'll add a few other criteria to
      this list as well, since I last stated it in <xref
      ref="section-proofs-week7" />. 
    </p>
    <proposition>

      Here are two more properties of determinants.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be <m>n \times n</m> matrices and
          let <m>\alpha \in \RR</m> be a scalar.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \det (AB) \amp  = \det (BA)
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \det \alpha A \amp  = \alpha^n \det A
            </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      Row reduction is an important operation on matrices. It is
      convenient to know how the determinant changes under row
      operations.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix. If two rows are
          exchanges, the determinant changes sign (positive to
          negative, negative to positive). If a row is multiplied by a
          constant <m>\alpha</m>, the determinant is multiplied by the
          same constant <m>\alpha</m>. If a multiple of one row is
          added to another, the determinant is (surprisingly) 
          unchanged.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      All of the properties of determinant listed so far have been
      multiplicative. The situation for matrix addition and
      determinants is less elegant: <m>\det (A + B)</m> has no
      pleasant identity. This is an interesting contrast from many of
      the other things in this course: determinants are not linear
      functions <m>M_n(\RR) \rightarrow \RR</m> since they do not act
      nicely with addition.  Instead, they act nicely with
      multiplication. On sets with various algebraic structures, it is
      common for an operation to interact well with one structure but
      poorly with the others.
