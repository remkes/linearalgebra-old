      <p>
        Determine an orthogonal transformation of <m>\RR^3</m> which
        reflects over the plane <m>x + y = 0</m>. Write the matrix and
        check that it satisfies the properties of orthogonal matrices.
        (4) 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Create a multiplication table for <m>D_6</m>. (You do not need
        to show all the vertex calculations but show at least a few
        from different parts of the table to give examples of how you
        did the calculations.) Label the identity as <m>\Id</m>. Label
        the rotations as <m>R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4</m> and <m>R_5</m> as
        counter-clockwise rotations of one-sixth of a turn, two-sixths
        of a turn, and so on. Label a reflection through two vertices
        (along the <m>x</m>-axis if you wish) as <m>F_1</m>. Then label
        the remaining reflections as <m>F_2, F_3, F_4, F_5</m> and
        <m>F_6</m> so that each line reflection is the next line
        moving counter-clockwise. In this way, <m>F_1</m>, <m>F_3</m>
        and <m>F_5</m> are reflections over lines through two vertices
        and <m>F_2</m>, <m>F_4</m> and <m>F_6</m> are reflections over
        lines through the midpoints of two edges. (10)
