    <title>Dot Products and Loci</title>
    <p>
      Loci are the solutions to one of more linear equations. These
      linear equation can be re-interpreted and expressed via via dot
      products. Consider, again, the general linear equation in
      <m>\RR^n</m>.
      <me>
        a_1 u_1 + a_2 u_2 + \ldots + a_n u_n = c
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of the variables <m>u_i</m> as the components of a vector
      <m>u \in \RR^n</m>. There also are <m>n</m> scalars <m>a_i</m>,
      which I can likewise treat as components of the vector <m>a \in
      \RR^n</m>. The vector <m>u</m> is variable; the vector <m>a</m>
      is constant. Then I can re-write the linear equation using these
      two vectors.
      <me>
        a_1 u_1 + a_2 u_2 + \ldots + a_n u_n = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\
        a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} u_1
        \\ u_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n \end{pmatrix} = a \cdot u = c
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, a linear equation specifies that the dot product
      result of a variable vector <m>u</m> with a fixed vector
      <m>a</m> must have the result <m>c</m>. In this light, an
      affine plane in <m>\RR^3</m> is given by the equation
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix} 
          x \\ y \\ z 
        \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 
          a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 
        \end{pmatrix} = c
      </me>. 
      This plane is precisely all vectors whose dot product with the
      vector <m>\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}</m> is
      the fixed number <m>c</m>. If <m>c=0</m>, the equation become 
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix} 
          x \\ y \\ z 
        \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 
          a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 
        \end{pmatrix} = 0
      </me>. 
      A dot product of zero indicates that the two inputs to the dot
      product are perpendicular. Therefore, a plane through the origin
      is the set of all vectors which are perpendicular to a fixed
      vector <m>\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}</m>.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>P</m> be a plane in <m>\RR^3</m> determined by the
          equation 
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix} 
              x \\ y \\ z 
            \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 
              a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 
            \end{pmatrix} = c
          </me>.
          The vector <m>\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3
          \end{pmatrix}</m> is called the <term>normal to the
          plane</term>. Let <m>H</m> be a hyperplane in <m>\RR^n</m>
          determined by the equivalent equation in <m>\RR^n</m>.
          <me>
            u \cdot a = \begin{pmatrix} 
              u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n
            \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 
              a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n 
            \end{pmatrix} = c
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The vector <m>a</m> is called the <term>normal to the
          hyperplane</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If <m>c=0</m>, the plane or hyperplane is perpendicular to its
      normal. This notion of orthogonality still works when <m>c \neq
      0</m>. In this case, the normal is a <em>local</em>
      perpendicular direction from any point on the affine plane.
      Treating any such point as a local origin, the normal points in
      a direction perpendicular to all the <em>local direction</em>
      vectors which lie on the plane.

      Now I can build a general process for finding the equation of a
      plane in <m>\RR^3</m>. Any time I have a point <m>p</m> on the
      plane and two <em>local direction vectors</em> <m>u</m> and
      <m>v</m> which remain on the plane, I can find a normal to the
      plane by calculating <m>u \times v</m>. Then I can find the
      equation of the plane by calculating the dot product <m>p \cdot
      (u \times v)</m> to find the constant <m>c</m>.
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} \cdot (u \times v) =
        c
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If I am given three points on a plane (<m>p</m>, <m>q</m> and
      <m>r</m>), then I can use <m>p</m> as the local origin and
      construct the local direction vectors as <m>q-p</m> and
      <m>r-p</m>. The normal is <m>(q-p) \times (r-p)</m>. In this
      way, I can construct the equation of a plane given three points
      or a single point and two local directions.
