      Before we talk about properties of dot/cross products and proof,
      I want to step back to take a much more abstract look at what we
      are accomplishing. I said in <xref
      ref="section-themes" /> that algebra was the study of
      sets with (algebraic) structures. I want to use this section to
      explain that idea. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I should start with sets, very briefly. Set theory is a whole
      branch of mathematics itself, but I'm not going into the
      details. It is enough for us to know that a set is a collection
      of things. In many places in mathematics, sets are collections
      of numbers. In other courses, you may have seen some of these:
      the set of natural numbers (<m>\NN</m>); the set of integers
      (<m>\ZZ</m>); the set of rational numbers (<m>\QQ</m>); the set
      of real numbers (<m>\RR</m>); or intervals on the number line
      (such as <m>(1,4]</m>). However, sets can contain anything we
      want. In this course, we'll have sets of vectors and sets of
      matrices.

    <title>Sets with Structure</title>
    <p>
      So what do I mean when I say <qt>sets with structure</qt>? What
      is a structure? A structure is a mathematical construction on a
      set <mdash /> something that we can do, mathematically, with the
      elements of the set. This is best illustrated by some very
      familiar examples.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Addition is a structure on many number sets. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Subtraction is a structure on many number sets. Subtraction is
        not a structure on <m>\NN</m>, however. <m>4</m> and
        <m>7</m> are natural numbers, but <m>4 - 7 = -3</m> is no
        longer a natural number. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiplication is a structure on many number sets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Division by non-zero elements is a structure on many number
        sets. Note that we have to make sure to exclude zero, since
        for sets that have zero, division by zero is undefined.
        Division is not a structure on <m>\NN</m>; like with
        subtraction, even though <m>4</m> and <m>7</m> are natural
        numbers, <m>\frac{4}{7}</m> is not a natural number.
      </li>
      <li>
        The four previous examples are all types of <em>binary
        relations</em>. They are structures that take two elements
        from the set and combine them together to produce something
        new from the set. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The dot product is a new binary operation on <m>\RR^n</m>, and
        a strange one, since its output is a different kind of object.
        It takes two vectors and produces a scalar.
      </li>
      <li>
        The cross product is a binary operation on vectors in
        <m>\RR^3</m>. 
      </li>
      <li>
        There are also structures that are not binary operations.
        Less than and greater than are structures on many number sets. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Absolute value is also a structure on many number sets. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This list is just the start of many, many kinds of algebraic
      structures that we can consider on sets. When we think about
      linear algebra abstractly, we are building new structures on
      sets of vectors and analyzing their properties. The dot product
      and the cross product are the new structures we've introduced in
      Week 2; there will be more to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the activity for this week, I'll ask you to think about the
      abstract idea of sets with structure.
