      Before I talk about properties of dot/cross products and proof,
      I want to step back to take a much more abstract look at what I
      am accomplishing. I said in <xref ref="section-themes" /> that
      algebra was the study of sets with (algebraic) structures. I
      want to use this section to explain that idea. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I should start with sets, very briefly. Set theory is a whole
      branch of mathematics itself, but I'm not going into the
      details. It is enough for to know that a set is a collection
      of things. In many places in mathematics, sets are collections
      of numbers. In other courses, you may have seen some of these:
      the set of natural numbers (<m>\NN</m>); the set of integers
      (<m>\ZZ</m>); the set of rational numbers (<m>\QQ</m>); the set
      of real numbers (<m>\RR</m>); or intervals on the number line
      (such as <m>(1,4]</m>). However, sets can contain anything I
      want. In this course, I'll have sets of vectors and sets of
      matrices.

    <title>Sets with Structure</title>
    <p>
      So what do I mean when I say <sq>sets with structure</sq>? What
      is a structure? A structure is a mathematical construction on a
      set <mdash /> something that I can do, mathematically, with the
      elements of the set. This is best illustrated by some very
      familiar examples.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Addition is a structure on many number sets. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Subtraction is a structure on many number sets. Subtraction is
        not a structure on <m>\NN</m>, however. <m>4</m> and
        <m>7</m> are natural numbers, but <m>4 - 7 = -3</m> is no
        longer a natural number. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiplication is a structure on many number sets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Division by non-zero elements is a structure on many number
        sets. Note that zero must be excluded, since for sets that
        have zero, division by zero is undefined.  Division is not a
        structure on <m>\NN</m>; like with subtraction, even though
        <m>4</m> and <m>7</m> are natural numbers, <m>\frac{4}{7}</m>
        is not a natural number.
      </li>
      <li>
        The four previous examples are all types of <em>binary
        relations</em>. They are structures that take two elements
        from the set and combine them together to produce something
        new from the set. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The dot product is a new binary operation on <m>\RR^n</m>, and
        a strange one, since its output is a different kind of object.
        It takes two vectors and produces a scalar.
      </li>
      <li>
        The cross product is a binary operation on vectors in
        <m>\RR^3</m>. 
      </li>
      <li>
        There are also structures that are not binary operations.
        Less than and greater than are structures on many number sets. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Absolute value is also a structure on many number sets. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This list is just the start of many, many kinds of algebraic
      structures that I can consider on sets. When I think about
      linear algebra abstractly, I am building new structures on
      sets of vectors and analyzing their properties. The dot product
      and the cross product are the new structures I've introduced in
      Week 2; there will be more to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the activity for this week, I'll ask you to think about the
      abstract idea of sets with structure.
