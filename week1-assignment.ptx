        Consider three vectors in <m>\RR^2</m>. 
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \amp \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 3  \end{pmatrix} 
            \amp \amp \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} 
            \amp \amp \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \\ 1  \end{pmatrix}
          </mrow>
        </md>
        Check that the addition of all three vectors is independent of
        any re-ordering. Draw all six vectors additions on the same
        graph. How many paths are there from <m>\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0
        \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}</m> to the final sum through each vertex? (6)  
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        How many unit 4-cubes in <m>\RR^4</m> fill a 4-cube with side
        length <m>2</m>?  How many unit 5-cubes in <m>\RR^5</m> fill a
        5-cube with side length <m>2</m>?  What about <m>\RR^n</m>?
        (Give reasons for your answers). (4)

        Explain the difference between Propositions 1.5.4 and 1.5.5 in
        the course notes. Why is it necessary to have both
        propositions? (4)
