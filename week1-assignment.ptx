        A <m>n</m>-cross polytope contains lower dimensional
        cross-polytopes as facets, the same way that the cube contains
        the lower dimensional square as faces. One way to identify
        these facets is through vertex diagrams. Draw three copies of
        the vertex diagram for the <m>5</m>-cross polytope. In each
        copy, using a highlighter or thicker pen, identify an
        octahedron by finding a copy of the octahedron vertex diagram
        in the larger vertex diagram. (Obviously, find three different
        octahedra <mdash /> don't just repeat the same drawing). Even
        though you can't see the six dimensional object, this is still
        a consistent and valid way to find a three-dimensional object
        that forms part of the <sq>edge</sq> of the six dimensional
        object. (6)

        How many faces does the <m>7</m>-dimensional cube have?
        (Make sure you give your reasoning based on the construction
        of these cubes described in the videos and notes.) (4)

        Prove that scalar multiplication distributes over vector
        subtraction. (Note notes that this is very similar to the
        proof for commutativity. You can follow the structure of that
        proof). (6)
