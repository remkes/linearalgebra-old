        An ellipse is determined by a centre point, a greatest
        distance to the edge <m>a</m> in some direction and a least
        distance to the edge <m>b</m> in the perpendicular direction
        to the first. This produces an oval shape <mdash /> a circle
        if the two distances are the same. If the centre is the
        origin, the large distance is along the <m>x</m> axis, and the
        small distance is along the <m>y</m> axis, then the equation
        of the ellipse is 
        <me>
          \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 
        </me>.
        How does the ellipse generalize to <m>\RR^3</m>, <m>\RR^4</m>
        and higher-dimensional spaces? How much information is needed
        to determine the object (how many constants like the numbers
        <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>)? (4)

        How many vertices does the <m>n</m>-dimensional cube have?
        (Make sure you give your reasoning based on the construction
        of these cubes described in the videos and notes.) (4)

        Prove that vector addition is associative. (I said in the
        notes that this is very similar to the proof for
        commutativity. You can follow the structure of that proof).
