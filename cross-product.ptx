    <title>Definition of the Cross Product</title>
    <p>
      The dot product is an operation that can be performed on any
      two vectors in <m>\RR^n</m> for any <m>n \geq 1</m>. There are
      no other conventional products that work in all dimensions.
      However, there is a special product that works in three
      dimensions.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>u = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3
          \end{pmatrix}</m> and <m>v = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\
          v_3 \end{pmatrix}</m> be two vectors in <m>\RR^3</m>. The
          <term>cross product</term> of <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> is
          written <m>u \times v</m> and defined by the following
          formula.
          <me>
            u \times v = \begin{pmatrix} u_2v_3 - u_3v_2 \\ u_3v_1 -
            u_1v_3 \\ u_1v_2 - u_2v_1 \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The cross product differs from the dot product in several
      important ways. First, it produces a new vector in
      <m>\RR^3</m>, not a scalar. For this reason, when working in
      <m>\RR^3</m>, the dot product is often referred to as the
      <term>scalar product</term> and the cross product as the
      <term>vector product</term>. Second, the dot product measures,
      in some sense, the similarity of two vectors. The cross product
      measures, in some sense, the difference between two vectors. The
      cross product has a greater magnitude if the vectors are closer
      to being perpendicular. If <m>\theta</m> is the angle between
      <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>, the dot product was expressed in terms of
      <m>\cos \theta</m>. This measures similarity, since <m>\cos 0 =
      1</m>.  There is a similar identity for the cross product.
      <me>
        |u \times v| = |u||v| \sin \theta
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This identity tells me that the cross product measures
      difference in direction, since <m>\sin 0 = 0</m>. In
      particular, this tells me that <m>|u \times u| = 0</m>, implying
      that <m>u \times u = 0</m> (the zero vector is the only vector
      which has zero length). This is another new and strange
      property: in this particular multiplication, everything squares
      to zero. The cross product is obviously very different from the
      multiplication of scalars, where <m>a^2 = 0</m> cannot happen
      unless <m>a=0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also consider the relationship between <m>u</m> and
      <m>u \times v</m> as calculated through the dot product.

          u \cdot (u \times v) \amp = 
          \begin{pmatrix}
          u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3  
          \end{pmatrix} \cdot
          \begin{pmatrix}
          u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2 \\ u_3 v_1 - u_1 v_3 \\ u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1
          \end{pmatrix}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp = u_1u_2v_3 - u_1u_3v_2 + u_2u_3v_1 - u_2u_1v_3 +
          u_3u_1v_2 - u_3u_2v_1 = 0
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar calculation shows that <m>v \cdot (u \times v) =
      0</m>. Since a dot product of two vectors is zero if and only
      if the vectors are perpendicular, the vector <m>v \times u</m>
      is perpendicular to both <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>. This turns out
      to be a very useful property of the cross product.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, a calculation from the definition shows that <m>u
      \times v = -(v \times u)</m>. So far, multiplication of scalars
      and the dot product of vectors have not depended on order. The
      cross product is one of many products in mathematics which
      depends on order. If I change the order of the cross product,
      I introduce a negative sign.

        <p>
          Products that do not depend on the order of the factors,
          such as multiplication of scalars and the dot product of
          vectors, are called <term>commutative products</term>.
          Products where changing the order of the factors introduces
          a negative sign are called <term>anti-commutative
          products</term>. The cross product is an anti-commutative
          product. Other products that have neither of these
          properties are called <term>non-commutative
          products</term>.

    <title>Angular Motion</title>
    <p>
      An important application of the cross product is found in
      describing rotational motion. Linear mechanics describes the
      motion of an object through space, but rotational mechanics
      describes the rotation of an object independent of its movement
      through space. A force on an object can cause both kinds of
      movement, obviously. The following table summarizes the
      parallel questions of linear motion and rotational motion in
      <m>\RR^3</m>.

    <p>
      How should I describe torque?  If there is a linear force applied
      to an object which can only rotate around an axis, and if the
      linear force is applied at a distance <m>r</m> from the axis, I
      can think of the force <m>F</m> and the distance <m>r</m> as
      vectors. The torque is then <m>\tau = r \times F</m>. Notice
      that <m>|\tau| = |r||F| \sin \theta</m>, indicating that linear
      force perpendicular to the radius gives the greatest angular
      acceleration. That makes sense. If <m>F</m> and <m>r</m> share
      a direction, then I am pushing directly along the axis, and no
      rotation can occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of cross products in rotational dynamics is ubiquitous.
      In fluid dynamics, local rotational motion of the fluid result
      in turbulence, vortices and similar effects. Tornadoes and
      hurricanes are particularly extreme examples of vortices. All
      the descriptions of the force and motion of these vortices
      involve cross products in the vectors describing the fluid.
