        Consider the following Leslie matrix as a growth model for a
        population with four age categories. (9)
        <me>
          \begin{pmatrix}
            0 \amp 0.5 \amp 0.9 \amp 0.9 \\
            0.7 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
            0 \amp 0.5 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
            0 \amp 0 \amp 0.7 \amp 0 
          \end{pmatrix}
        </me>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>
          Does the species survive in the long run?
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          What is the eventual age profile?
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          If we change only the survival from the first to the second
          age category, how much do we need to change this coefficient
          so that the population become viable? (Adjusting the
          coefficient by tenths is fine since you may need guess and
          test the resulting eigenvalue.) 
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          How does survival change if we are allowed to change both
          survival from the first to the second age category and the
          fecundity of the second age category?
        </p></li>

        Consider the following Leslie matrix as a growth model for a
        population with six age categories. (6)
        <me>
          \begin{pmatrix}
            0 \amp 0 \amp 40 \amp 90 \amp 70 \amp 0 \\
            0.17 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ 
            0 \amp a \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ 
            0 \amp 0 \amp 0.45 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ 
            0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0.67 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ 
            0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp b \amp 0 \\ 
          \end{pmatrix}

        Assume this is a model for an invasive species, so the goal is
        exponential decay. By affecting the environment, you are able
        to change the coefficients <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. To the
        nearest hundredth, how small do you need to set <m>a</m> to
        make the population start to decay? If you try adjusting
        <m>b</m>, you will find that it doesn't actually affect the
        viability of the population at all. Why doesn't <m>b</m>
        matter for viability?

        <xref ref="figure-assignment-markov" /> shows a probability
        graph with four transition probabilities <m>C_1</m>,

        <li><p>
          Determine values for each of <m>C_1</m>, <m>C_2</m>,
          <m>C_3</m> and <m>C_4</m> to make this a valid probability
          graph.

          Write the matrix that describes the stochastic system.

          vertex.

          How would you change only three coefficients to make it so
          that the long term behaviour is to eventually end at vertex
          <m>5</m> with probability <m>1</m>?
