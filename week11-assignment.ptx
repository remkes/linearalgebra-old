        Consider the following Leslie matrices as a growth model for a
        population with four age categories. (10)

          Determine the long term behaviour for each of the four
          Leslie matrices. State the long term age profiles. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The three later matrices can be interpreted as changes to
          the first matrix. What is the result of those changes? How
          do the structure and viability of the population change
          going from one matrix to the next?

        Consider a probability model with four states. Here is a
        description of the transition probabilities. (8) 
      </p>
      <p><ul>
        <li>
          There is a <m>0.4</m> probability of transition from state 1 to
          state 2. 
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a <m>0.2</m> probability of transition from state 1 to
          state 3. 
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a <m>0.4</m> probability of transition from state 1 to
          state 4. 
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a <m>1</m> probability of transition from state 2 to
          state 3. 
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a <m>0.2</m> probability of transition from state 3 to
          state 2. 
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a <m>0.8</m>  probability of transition from state 3 to
          state 4. 
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a <m>0.4</m> probability of transition from state 4 to
          state 1. 
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a <m>0.6</m>  probability of transition from state 4 to
          state 2. 
        </li>
        <li>
          All other probabilities are zero. (This includes the fact
          that there is zero probability of staying in any of the four
          states.)  
        </li>
      </ul></p>
      <p><ol>
        <li>
          Draw the probability graph. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Write down the appropriate probability matrix.
        </li>
        <li>
          Determine the long term behaviour of the system and the long
          term probability of ending up in each state. 
        </li>
