  <title>Leslie Matrices</title>
  <p>
    Let's conisder a population broken down into finitely many age categories.
    Leslie matrices are a dynamical system which model the age structure of this population.
    To demonstrate, we'll assume there are four age categories,
    so the state vector <m>v_k</m> is in <m>\RR^4</m> and the matrix <m>C</m> is a <m>4 \times 4</m> matrix.
    If we use coordinates <m>w,x,y,z</m> in <m>\RR^4</m>,
    we can write the matrix equation for this dynamical system.
    <me>
      \colvec{4}{w_{k+1}}{x_{k+1}}{y_{k+1}}{z_{k+1}} = \left( \begin{matrix} f_1 \amp  f_2 \amp  f_3 \amp  f_4 \\ s_1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp s_2 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  s_3 \amp  0 \end{matrix} \right) \begin{pmatrix}4\\w_k\\x_k\\y_k\\z_k\end{pmatrix}
    </me>
  </p>

    Nine of the entries are set to zero intentionally,
    but we can interpret the remaining entries.
    The first row outputs to the first category,
    representing the creation of new members of the population.
    Each <m>f_i</m> is the <em>fecundity</em>
    of each population state:
    its rate of producing offspring.
    Of course, some of these might be zero,
    if only certain age categories produce offspring.
    The <m>s_i</m>, on the other hand,
    are transitions from one age category to the next.
    These are <em>survival rates</em>:
    <m>s_1</m> is the rate of survival from cateogry <m>1</m> to category <m>2</m>,
    <m>s_2</m> from category <m>2</m> to <m>3</m> and <m>s_3</m> from category <m>3</m> to <m>4</m>.
    The remaining elemnets of the second,
    third and fourth rows are zero since they represent unnatural jumps in age categories:
    i.e., no one goes from the third back down to the second age category.
  </p>

    These Leslie matrices are irreducible
    (recall that ireeducible meant that each state connects to the other;
    by survival and fertility,
    it is possible to pass from any age category to another over several years).
    This means that there is a unique largest eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> with a positive eigenvector.
    This is the value we care about:
    in the long run,
    the largest eigenvalue dominates and its eigenvector gives the stable age distribution.
    If <m>\lambda = 1</m>, we expect a stable population.
    If <m>\lambda > 1</m>, we expect exponential growth,
    and if <m>\lambda \lt 1</m> we expect exponential decay.
