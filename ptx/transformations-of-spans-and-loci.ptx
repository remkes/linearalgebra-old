    <title>Transformations of Spans</title>
    <p>
      Now that we have matrices to describe transformations,
      we want to know how transformations affect to linear subspaces.
      We know that they preserve them,
      but we want to be more specific:
      given a particular linear subspace,
      can we determine where it goes under a transformation?
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>M: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> is a transformation (represented by a
          <m>m \times n</m>and <m>L</m> is a linear or affine subspace of <m>\RR^n</m>,
          then the result of the matrix <m>M</m> acting on all vectors in <m>L</m> will be a linear or affine subspace of <m>\RR^m</m> called the
          <term>image of <m>L</m> under <m>M</m></term>.
          The image of all of <m>\RR^n</m> under <m>M</m> is simply called the
          <term>image of <m>M</m></term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The most important property of linear transformations is that they preserve addition and scalar multiplication.
      That means they preserve the linear combintaions.
      Let <m>a_i</m> be scalars and <m>v_i</m> be vectors in <m>\RR^n</m>,
      with <m>M</m> a <m>m\times n</m> matrix.
      <md>
        <mrow>M(a_1 v_1 + a_2v_2 + \ldots + a_kv_k) \amp  = M(a_1v_1) + M(a_2v_2) + \ldots + M(a_kv_k)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = a_1(Mv_1) + a_2(Mv_2) + \ldots + a_k (Mv_k)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We see that the image of a linear combination is still a linear combination,
      just in the vectors <m>Mv_i</m> instead of <m>v_i</m>.
      Since all elements of a span are linear combinations,
      we can say that everything in the span of the <m>v_i</m> is sent to the span of the vectors <m>Mv_i</m>.
      We can summarize these observations in a proposition.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A linear transformation represented by a
          <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>M</m> sends spans to spans.
          In particular, the span <m>\Span \{ v_1, v_2, \ldots,
          v_k\}</m> is sent to <m>\Span \{ Mv_1, Mv_2, \ldots, Mv_k\}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      Matrices acting on spans are easy:
      we just figure out where the individual vectors go and the span of those vectors will be transformed into the span of their images.
      Offset spans are almost as easy:
      consider an affine subspace <m>u + \Span \{ v_1, v_2, \ldots,
      v_k\}</m>.
      Any element of this looks like <m>u + a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + \ldots a_kv_k</m>.
      Under <m>M</m>, we have:
      <me>
        M(u + a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + \ldots + a_kv_k) = Mu + a_1 Mv_1 + a_2Mv_2 + \ldots + a_kMv_k
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The offset span is still sent to an offset span,
      with offset <m>Mu</m> and spanning vectors <m>Mv_i</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be careful that the matrix need not preserve the dimension of the span.
      Even if the <m>v_i</m> are linearly independent and form a basis for the span,
      the vectors <m>Mv_i</m> need not be linearly independent.
      The dimension of the new span might be smaller.

    <title>Transformation of Loci</title>
    <p>
      For loci, the picture is much more complicated.
      Equations do not transform nearly as pleasantly as spans.
      Planes in <m>\RR^3</m> are defined by a normal;
      we might hope that the new plane is defined by the image of the normal.
      Unfortunatly, since the matrix may not preserve orthogonality,
      this will usually not happen.
      To determine the image of a locus,
      the best solution is to describe the locus as a span or offset span find the image of the that span.
