  <title>Row Operations and Gaussian Elimination</title>
  <p>
    We defined three operations on systems of equations.
    Now that we have encoded systems as matrices,
    we need to understand the equivalent operations for matrices.
    Each equation in the system gives a row in the matrix;
    therefore, equation operations become row operations.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Multiply an equation by a non-zero constant
          <m>\implies</m> multiply a row by a non-zero constant.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Change the order of the equations
          <m>\implies</m> exchange two rows of a matrix.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add (a multiple of) an equation to another equation
          <m>\implies</m>add (a multiple of) one row to another row.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the original operations didn't change the solution of a system of equations,
    the row operations on matrices also preserve the solution of the associated system.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition,
    we need to know what a solution looks like in matrix form.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        This example shows the encoding of a direction solution.
        <men>
          \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  -3 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  -2 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  8 \end{array} \right)
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        The system has three columns before its vertical line,
        therefore it corresponds to a system of equation in <m>x,y,z</m>.
        If we translate this back into equations,
        we get the following system.
        <md>
          <mrow>x + 0y + 0z \amp  = -3</mrow>
          <mrow>0z + y + 0z \amp  = -2</mrow>
          <mrow>0x + 0y + z \amp  = 8</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Removing the zero terms gives <m>x=-3</m>,
        <m>y=-2</m> and <m>z=8</m>.
        This equation delivers its solution directly:
        no work is necessary.
        We just read the solution off the page.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    We have a name for the special form of a matrix where we can directly read the solutions of the associated linear system.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A matrix is a <term>reduced row-echelon</term> matrix,
        or is said to be in <term>reduced row-echelon form</term>,
        if the following things are true:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The first non-zero entry in each row is one. (A row entirely of zeros is fine).
              These entries are called leading ones.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Each leading one is in a column where all the other entries are zero.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    We shall see that as long as an extended matrix is in reduced row-echelon form,
    we can always directly read off the solution to the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Knowing how to recognize solutions in matrix form and knowing the row operations,
    we can now state our matrix-based approach to solving linear systems.
    First, we to translate a system into a matrix.
    We then use row operations
    (which don't change the solution at all)
    to turn the matrix into reduced row-echelon form,
    where we can just read off the solution.
    Row operations will always be able to accomplish this.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The process of using row operations to change a matrix into reduced row echelon form is called
        <term>Guassian elimantion</term>
        or <term>row reduction</term>.
        This process proceeds in the following steps.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Take a row which has a non-zero entry in the first column. (Often we exchange this row with the first,
              so that we are working on the first row).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Multiply by a constant to get a leading one in this row.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Now that we have a leading one,
              we want to clear all the other entries in the first column.
              Thererfore, we add multiples of the row with the leading one to the other rows,
              one by one, to make those first column entries zero.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              That produces a column with a leading one in the first colum and sets all other first column entries zero.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Then we proceed to the next column and repeat the process all over again.
              Any column which is all zeros is skipped.
              Any row which is all zeros is also left alone.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
