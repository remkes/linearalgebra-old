  <title>The Cross Product</title>
  <p>
    The dot product is an operation which can be performed on any two vectors in <m>\RR^n</m> for any <m>n \geq 1</m>.
    There are no other conventional products that work in all dimensions.
    However, there is a special product that works in three dimensions.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>u</m> = <img src="MISSINGFILE"  width="400" /> and <m>v</m> = <img src="MISSINGFILE"  width="400" /> be two vectors in <m>\RR^3</m>.
        The <term>cross product</term> of <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> is written
        <m>u \times v</m> and defined by the following formula.
        <me>
          u \times v = \begin{pmatrix}3\\u_2v_3 - u_3v_2\\u_3v_1 - u_1v_3\\u_1v_2 - u_2v_1\end{pmatrix}
        </me>
      </p>

    The cross product differs from the dot product in several important ways.
    First, it produces a new vector in <m>\RR^3</m>, not a scalar.
    For this reason, when working in <m>\RR^3</m>,
    the dot product is often refered to as the <em>scalar product</em>
    and the cross product as the <em>vector product</em>.
    Second, the dot product measures,
    in some sense, the similarity of two vectors.
    The cross product measures, in some sense,
    the difference between two vectors.
    The cross product has greater magnitude if the vectors are closer to being perpendicular.
    If <m>\theta</m> is the angle between <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>,
    the dot product was expressed in terms of <m>\cos \theta</m>.
    This measures similarity, since <m>\cos 0 = 1</m>.
    There is a similar identity for the cross product:
    <me>
      |u \times v| = |u||v| \sin \theta
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    This identity tells us that the cross product measures difference in direction,
    since <m>\sin 0 = 0</m>.
    In particular, this tells us that <m>|u \times u| = 0</m>,
    implying that <m>u \times u = 0</m>
    (the zero vector is the only vector which has zero length).
    This is another new and strange property:
    in this particular multiplication,
    everything squares to zero.
    The cross product is obviously very different from multiplication of scalars,
    where <m>a^2 = 0</m> cannot happen unless <m>a=0</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also consider the relationship between <m>u</m> and
    <m>u \times v</m> as calculated through the dot product.
    <md>
      <mrow>u \cdot (u \times v) \amp  = \begin{pmatrix}3</mrow>
      <mrow>u_1</mrow>
      <mrow>u_2</mrow>
      <mrow>u_3\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}3</mrow>
      <mrow>u_2v_3 - u_3v_2</mrow>
      <mrow>u_3v_1 - u_1v_3</mrow>
      <mrow>u_1v_2 - u_2v_1\end{pmatrix}</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = u_1u_2v_3 - u_1u_3v_2 + u_2u_3v_1 - u_2u_1v_3 + u_3u_1v_2 - u_3u_2v_1 = 0</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    A similar calculation shows that <m>v \cdot (u \times v) = 0</m>.
    Since a dot product of two vectors is zero if and only if the vectors are perpendicular,
    the vector <m>v \times u</m> is perpendicular to both <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>.
    This turns out to be a very useful property of the cross product.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, a calculation from the definition shows that <m>u \times v = -(v \times u)</m>.
    So far, multiplication of scalars and the dot product of vectors have not depended on order.
    The cross product is one of many products in mathematics which depends on order.
    If we change the order of the cross product,
    we introduce a negative sign.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Products which do not depend on the order of the factors,
        such as multiplication of scalars and the dot product of vectors,
        are called <term>commutative products</term>.
        Products where changing the order of the factors introduces a negative sign are caled
        <term>anti-commutative products</term>.
        The cross product is an anti-commutative product.
        Other products which have neither of these properties are called
        <term>non-commutative products</term>.
