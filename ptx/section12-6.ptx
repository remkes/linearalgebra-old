  <title>Dihedral Groups</title>
  <p>
    The case of regular polygons,
    such as the hexagon, is a very useful place for us to start.
    Transformations which do not preserve flat objects may not going to preserve the edges of the polygons.
    Therefore, we want to know which linear transformations preserve the regular polygons.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>Dihedral Group</term> is the group of linear symmetries of a regular polygon.
        If the polygon has <m>n</m> edges,
        then we write <m>D_n</m> for the associated dihedral group.
        Thus, <m>D_3</m> is the group of symmetries of the triangle,
        <m>D_4</m> is the group of symmetries of the square,
        <m>D_5</m> is the group of symmetries of the pentagon,
        and so on.
        (Some texts use <m>D_{2n}</m> instead of <m>D_n</m>.)
      </p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let's first consider the square.
        For all the polygons we are considering,
        we assume the origin is at the centre of the polygon.
        We can assume the square has vertices <m>(1,1)</m>, <m>(1,-1)</m>,
        <m>(-1,-1)</m> and <m>(-1,1)</m>.
        Conveniently, the vertices are all we need to think about:
        since linear transformations preserve lines,
        if we know where the vertices go,
        then we know that the lines connecting them are preserved and hence the shape is preseved.
        Which transformations preserve the vertices?
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two relatively obvious classes that might occur to us.
        First, there are rotation about the origin.
        If we rotate by <m>\pi/2</m> radians (a quarter turn),
        the vertices are preserved.
        Likewise for rotations by <m>\pi</m> and <m>3\pi/2</m> radians.
        If we are really paying attention,
        we might also think of rotation by <m>2\pi</m> radians,
        a full turn.
        This might seem silly, but the identity transformation
        (the transformation that leaves everything fixed)
        is a very important transformation and should be included in the list.
        So, for now, we have the identity and three rotations.
      </p>
      <p>
        We might also think about reflections.
        Looking at the square, we can find four lines of reflection:
        the <m>x</m>-axs, the <m>y</m>-axis,
        the line <m>x=y</m> and the line <m>x=-y</m>.
        That brings the total number of transformation to eight:
        the identity, three rotations, and four reflections.
        These eight are, in face, the complete group.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    You may have noticed that we used the work <sq>group</sq> instead of <sq>set</sq> to describe this collection.
    <sq>Group</sq> is a technical word in mathematics,
    refering to a set with some extra properties.
    We won't go into the formal details,
    but we'll use the dihedral groups as archetypical examples.
    There are three properties of the dihedral groups which hold for all groups.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The composition of two elements of the group is still in the group.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The identity transformation is in the group.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The inverse operation of any group element is still a group element.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Though we haven't formally defined inverses,
    the third property is not to hard to see for the dihedral groups.
    For the reflections,
    if we perform the reflection again we get back to where we started.
    The reflections are their own inverses.
    For rotations,
    we add another rotation so that we have completed a full turn.
    The inverse of rotation by <m>\pi/2</m> radians is rotation by <m>3\pi/2</m> radians.
    Equivalently, the inverse is rotation by <m>-\pi/2</m> radians.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first property is a little trickier.
    We leave it to you to try out some compositions of rotations and reflections to see how the result is still one of the eight symmetries.
    Likewise, we leave it to you to extend this analysis of <m>D_4</m> to other diheadral groups:
    <m>D_3</m>, <m>D_5</m>, <m>D_6</m> and so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    All dihedral groups are composed of the identity,
    some rotations, and some reflections.
    <m>D_4</m> is a useful enough example that we should fix notation.
    I or <m>\Id</m> is the identity transformation,
    <m>R_1</m> is rotation by <m>\pi/2</m> radians,
    <m>R_2</m> is rotation by <m>\pi</m>radians and <m>R_3</m> is rotation by <m>3\pi/2</m> radians.
    <m>F_1</m> is reflection over the <m>x</m> axis,
    <m>F_2</m> over <m>x=y</m>,
    <m>F_3</m> over the <m>y</m> axis and <m>F_4</m> over <m>y=-x</m>.
