        In linear algebra, ordinary numbers (intergers,
        rational numbers or real numbers) are called <term>scalars</term>.

        A <term>vector</term> is a finite ordered list of scalars.
        Vectors can be written either as columns or rows.
        If a vector is a list of the numbers <m>4</m>,
        <m>15</m>, <m>\pi</m> and <m>-e</m>
        (in that order),
        we write the vector in one of two ways.
        <men>
          \begin{pmatrix}4\\4\\15\\\pi\\e\end{pmatrix} \hspace{1cm} \text{ or } \hspace{1cm} (4, 15, \pi, -e)
        </men>
      </p>
    </statement>

  <p>
    In these notes, we will exclusively use column vectors.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer.
        <term>Real Euclidean Space</term>
        or <term>Cartesian Space</term>, written <m>\RR^n</m>,
        is the set of all vectors of length <m>n</m> with real number entries.
        An arbitrary element of <m>\RR^n</m> is written as a column.
        <men>
          \begin{pmatrix}4\\x_1\\x_2\\\vdots\\x_n\end{pmatrix}
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        We say that <m>\RR^n</m> has <term>dimension</term> <m>n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The scalars <m>x_i</m> in a vector are called the <term>entries</term>,
        <term>coordinates</term> or <term>components</term> of that vector.
        Specifically, <m>x_1</m> is the first coordinate,
        <m>x_2</m> is the second coordinate, and so on.
        For <m>\RR^2</m>, <m>\RR^3</m> and <m>\RR^4</m>,
        we use the letters <m>w,x,y,z</m> instead of <m>x_i</m>.
        <men>
          \begin{pmatrix}2\\x\\y\end{pmatrix} \in \RR^2 \hspace{1cm} \begin{pmatrix}3\\x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix} \in \RR^3 \hspace{1cm} \begin{pmatrix}4\\w\\x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix} \in \RR^4
        </men>
      </p>
    </statement>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In any <m>\RR^n</m>, the <term>origin</term>
        is the unique point given by a vector of zeros.
        It is also called the zero vector.
        It is considered the centre point of Cartesian space.
        <men>
          \begin{pmatrix}4\\0\\0\\\vdots\\0\end{pmatrix}
        </men>

  <p>
    Cartesian space, particularly the Cartesian plane,
    is a familiar object from high-school mathematics.
    We usually visualize Cartesian space by drawing axes,
    one in each independent perpendicular direction.
    In this visualization,
    the vector <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> corresponds to the unique point we get moving <m>a</m> units in the direction of the <m>x</m> axis and <m>b</m> units in the direction of the <m>y</m> axis.
    <xref ref="Points_in_the_Cartesian_Plane">Figure</xref>
    shows the location of several points in <m>\RR^2</m>.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="Points_in_Cartesian_three-space">
    <caption>Points in Cartesian three-space <m>\RR^3</m></caption>
    <image width="700%" source="images/figure2.png" />
  </figure>
  <p>
    As with <m>\RR^2</m>, the point <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" />
    <m>\in \RR^3</m> is the unique point we find by moving <m>a</m> units in the <m>x</m> direction,
    <m>b</m> units in the <m>y</m> direction and <m>c</m> units in the <m>z</m> direction.
    When we visualize <m>\RR^2</m>,
    we conventionally write the <m>x</m> axis horizontally,
    with a positive direction to the right,
    and the <m>y</m> axis vertically,
    with a positive direction upwards.
    For <m>\RR^3</m>,
    the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes form a flat plane and the <m>z</m> axis extend vertically from that plan,
    as shown in <xref ref="Points_in_Cartesian_three-space">Figure</xref>.
    Notice, in both cases, we needed to choose directions for the axes.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A choice of axis directions in a visualization of <m>\RR^n</m> is called an <term>orientation</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    While we can visualize <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m> relatively easily and efficiently,
    but we can't visualize any higher <m>\RR^n</m>.
    However, this doesn't prevent us from working in higher dimensions.
    We need to rely on the algebraic descriptions of vectors instead of the drawings and visualizations of <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In our visualizations of <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m>,
    we see the different axes as fundementally different perpendicular directions.
    We can think of <m>\RR^2</m> as the space with two independent directions and <m>\RR^3</m> as the space with three independent directions.
    Similarly, <m>\RR^4</m> is the space with four perpendicular,
    independent directions,
    even though it is impossible to visualize such a thing.
    Likewise, <m>\RR^n</m> is the space with <m>n</m> independent directions.
