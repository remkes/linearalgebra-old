      <p>
        If we have a system of equations in the variables <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n</m>,
        the set of values for these variables which satisfy all the equations is called the
        <term>solutions space</term> of the system.
        Since each set of values is a vector,
        we think of the solution space as a subset of <m>\RR^n</m>.
        For linear equations,
        the solution space will always be a affine subspace.
        If we have encoded the system of equations in an extended matrix,
        we can refer to the solution space of the matrix instead of the system.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Since solution spaces are affine,
        they can be written as <m>u + L</m> where <m>u</m> is a fixed offset vector and <m>L</m> is a linear space.
        Since <m>L</m> is linear,
        it has a basis <m>v_1, v_2, \ldots v_k</m> and any vector in <m>L</m> is a linear combination of the <m>v_i</m>.
        We can write any and all solutions to the system in the following fashion
        (where <m>a_i \in \RR</m>).
        <me>
          u + a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + a_3v_3 + \ldots + a_kv_k
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        In such a description of the solution space,
        we call the <m>a_i</m> <term>free parameters</term>.
        One of our goals in solving systems is to determine the number of free parameters for each solution space.
      </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let's return to the example at the start of this section to understand how we read solutions from reduced row-echelon matrices.
        <men>
          \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  -3 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  -2 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  8 \end{array} \right)
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        This example is the easiest case:
        we have a leading one in each row and column left of the horizontal line,
        and we just read off the solution,
        <m>x=-3</m>, <m>y=-2</m> and <m>z=8</m>.
        Several other things can happen, though,
        which we will also explain by examples.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We might have a row of zeros in the reduced row-echelon form.
        <men>
          \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  -3 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  -2 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  8 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \end{array} \right)
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        This row of zeros doesn't actually change the solution at all:
        it is still <m>x=-3</m>, <m>y=-2</m> and <m>z=8</m>.
        The last line just corresponds to an equation which says
        <m>0x + 0y + 0z = 0</m> or just <m>0=0</m> which is always true.
        Rows of zeros arise from redundant equations in the original system.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We might have a column of zeros.
        Consider something similar to the previous examples,
        but now in four variables <m>w,x,y,z</m>. (In that order,
        so that the first column is the <m>w</m> column,
        the second is the <m>x</m> column, and so on).
        <men>
          \left( \begin{array}{cccc|c} 1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  -3 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  -2 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  8 \end{array} \right)
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        The translation gives <m>w=-3</m>,
        <m>x=-2</m> and <m>y=8</m> but the matrix says nothing about <m>z</m>.
        A column of zeros corresponds to a free variable:
        any value of <m>z</m> solves the system as long as the other variables are set.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The columns of a free variables need not contain all zeros.
        The following matrix is still in reduced row-echelon form.
        <men>
          \left( \begin{array}{cccc|c} 1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  2 \amp  -3 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  -1 \amp  -2 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  -1 \amp  8 \end{array} \right)
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        Reduced row-echelon form needs a leading one in each non-zero row,
        and all other entries in a column with a lead one must be zero.
        This matrix satisfies all the conditions.
        The fourth column corresponds to the <m>z</m> variable,
        but lacks a leading one.
        Any column lacking a leading one corresponds to a free variable.
        Look at the translation of this matrix back into a linear system.
        <md>
          <mrow>w + 2z \amp  = -3</mrow>
          <mrow>x - z \amp  = -2</mrow>
          <mrow>y - z \amp  = 8</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's move the <m>z</m> terms to the right side.
        <md>
          <mrow>w \amp  = - 2z - 3</mrow>
          <mrow>x \amp  = z - 2</mrow>
          <mrow>y \amp  = z + 8</mrow>
          <mrow>z \amp  = z</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        We've added the last equation,
        which is trivial to satisfy, to show how all the terms depend on <m>z</m>.
        This makes it clear that <m>z</m> is a free variable,
        since we can write the solution as follows:
        <me>
          \begin{pmatrix}4\\w\\x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}4\\-3\\-2\\8\\0\end{pmatrix} + z \begin{pmatrix}4\\-2\\1\\1\\1\end{pmatrix}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Any choice of <m>z</m> will solve this system.
        If we want specific solutions,
        we take specific values of <m>z</m>.
        For example, if <m>z=1</m>,
        these equations give <m>w=-5, x=-1</m> and <m>y=9</m>.
        Moreover, this solutions is explicity given as an offset spane,
        where the columns of constants is the offset and the free variable gives the span.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We can go further.
        The following matrix is also in reduced row-echelon form
        (again, using <m>w</m>, <m>x</m>,
        <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> as variables in that order).
        <men>
          \left( \begin{array}{cccc|c} 1 \amp  0 \amp  3 \amp  2 \amp  -3 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  -1 \amp  -1 \amp  -2 \end{array} \right)
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, both the third and the fourth columns have no leading one,
        therefore, both <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> are free variables.
        We translate the matrix back into a linear system.
        <md>
          <mrow>w \amp  = -3y - 2z - 3</mrow>
          <mrow>x \amp  = y+z-2</mrow>
          <mrow>y \amp  = y</mrow>
          <mrow>z \amp  = z</mrow>
        </md>
        <me>
          \begin{pmatrix}4\\w\\x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}4\\-3\\2\\0\\0\end{pmatrix} + y \begin{pmatrix}4\\-3\\1\\1\\0\end{pmatrix} + z \begin{pmatrix}4\\-2\\1\\0\\1\end{pmatrix}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Any choice of <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> gives a solution.
        For example,
        if <m>y=0</m> and <m>z=1</m> then <m>w=-5</m> and <m>x=-1</m> completes a solution.
        Since we have all these choices,
        any system with a free variable has infinitely many solutions.
      </p>
    </statement>

        Finally, we can also have a reduced row-echelon matrix of the following form.
        <men>
          \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  -3 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  -2 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  8 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \end{array} \right)
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        The first three rows translate well.
        However, the fourth row translates to <m>0x+0y+0z = 1</m> or <m>0=1</m>.
        Obviously, this can never be satisfied.
        Any row which translates to <m>0=1</m> leads to a contradiction:
        this means that the system has no solutions,
        since we can never satisfy an equation like <m>0=1</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    We summarize the three possible situations for reduced row-echelon matrices.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          If there is a row which translates to <m>0=1</m>,
          then there is a contradiction and the system has no solutions.
          This overrides any other information:
          whether or not there are free variables elsewhere,
          there are still no solutions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If there are no <m>0=1</m> rows and all columns left of the vertical line have leading ones,
          then there is a unique solution.
          There are no columns representing free variables,
          and each variable has a specific value which we can read directly from the matrix.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If there are no <m>0=1</m> rows and there is at least one column left of the vertical line without a leading one,
          then each such column represents a free variable.
          The remaining variables can be expressed in terms of the free variables and any choices of the free variables leads to a solution.
          There are infinitely many solutions.
          The solutions space can always be expressed as a offset span.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    In particular,
    note that there are only three basic cases for the number of solutions:
    none, one, or infinitely many.
    No linear system has exactly two or exactly three solutions.
    In the case of infinitely many solutions,
    the interesting question is the dimension of the solution space.
    This question, however, is easily answered.
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The dimension of a solution space of a linear system of equations is the number of free variables.
      </p>
