  <title>Linear Transformations of <m>\RR^2</m></title>
  <p>
    It is useful for us to specialize to transformations <m>\RR^2 \rightarrow \RR^2</m>,
    in order to build experience and intuition.
    As we noted above, linear transformations preserve flat objects.
    What can we do to <m>\RR^2</m> that preserves lines and preserves the origin?
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        There are five basic types of linear transformation of <m>\RR^2</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Rotations</em> about the origin
        (either clockwise or counter-clockwise)
        preserve lines.
        We can't rotate around any other point,
        since that would move the origin.
        Since we can choose any angle,
        there are infinitely many such rotations.
        Also, since rotating by <m>\theta</m> radians clockwise is the same as
        <m>2\pi - \theta</m> radians counter-clockwise,
        we typically choose to only deal with counter-clockwise rotations.
        Counter-clockwise rotations are considered positive and clockwise rotations are considered negative.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Reflections</em> over lines through the origin preserve lines.
        The line of refleciton must passthrough the origin or else the reflection will move the origin.
        Since there are infinitely many different lines through the origin,
        there are infinitely many such reflections.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Skews</em> are a little tricker to visualize.
        A skew is a transformation that takes either veritcal or horizontal lines
        (but not both)
        and tilts them diagonally.
        It changes squares into parallelograms.
        The tilted lines are still lines,
        so it is a linear transformation.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Dialations</em> are transformation which stretch or shink in various directions.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Projections</em> are transformations which collapse <m>\RR^2</m> down to a line through the origin.
        Two important examples are projection onto either axis.
        Projection onto the <m>x</m> axis sends a point <m>(a,b)</m> to <m>(a,0)</m>,
        removing the <m>y</m> component.
        Likewise, projection onto the <m>y</m> axis sends a point <m>(a,b)</m> to <m>(0,b)</m>,
        removing the <m>x</m> component.
        In a similar manner,
        we can project onto any line though the origin by sending each point to the closest point on the line.
        Finally, there is the projection to the origin which sends all points to the origin.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

    We present the following interesting theorem without proof.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        All linear transformation of <m>\RR^2</m> are generated by composition of transformations of the previous five types.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
