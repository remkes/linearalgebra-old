    <title>System of Linear Equations</title>
    <p>
      So far, the focus of this course has been geometric. 
      In this section, I change my perspective to look at the
      algebraic side of linear algebra. A major problem in algebra is
      solving systems of equations: given several equations in several
      variables, can I find values for each variable that satisfy
      all the equations? In general, algebra considers any kind of
      equation.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <md>
          <mrow>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \amp = 3</mrow>
          <mrow>xy + 2xz - 3yz \amp = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>x+y+z \amp = 3</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
          This system is solved by <m>\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z
          \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
          </m> When substituted in the equations, these values satisfy
          all three. No other triples satisfy, so this is a unique
          solution.
        </p>
      </statement>

      Solving arbitrary systems of equations is a very difficult
      problem. There are two initial techniques, which are usually
      taught in high-school mathematics: isolating and replacing
      variables; or performing arithmetic with the equations
      themselves. Both are useful techniques. However, when the
      equations become quite complicated, both methods can fail. In
      that case, solutions to systems can only be approached with
      approximation methods. The methodology of these approximations
      is a whole branch of mathematics in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am going to restrict myself to a class of systems that
      are more approachable: systems of linear equations. Recall the
      definition of a linear equation from <xref
      ref="definition-linear-equation" />. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a_i</m> and <m>c</m> be real numbers. A <term>linear
          equation</term> in the variables <m>x_1, x_2 \ldots, x_n</m>
          is an equation of the following form.
          <me>
            a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \ldots + a_n x_n = c
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Given a fixed set of variables <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n</m>, I
      want to consider systems of linear equations in those variables.
      While much simpler than the general case, linear systems are a
      common and useful type of system to consider. Such systems also
      work well with arithmetic solution techniques since I can add
      two linear equations together and still have a linear equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This turns out to be the key idea: I can do arithmetic with
      linear equations. Specifically, there are three things I can
      do with a system of linear equations. These three techniques
      <em>preserve the solutions</em>; that is, they don't alter the
      values of the variables that solve the system.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Multiply a single equation by a (non-zero) constant.
            (Multiplying both sides of the equation, of course).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Change the order of the equations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Add one equation to another.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If I combine the first and third, I could restate the third
      as: add a multiple of one equation to another. In practice, I
      often think of the third operation this way.

      If I worked with the equations directly, I would find, with
      careful application of the three techniques, I could always
      solve linear systems. However, the notation becomes cumbersome
      for large systems. Therefore, matrices are used to encode
      the information in a nicely organized way.

      In this way, I can change any system of linear equations into an
      extended matrix (with one column after the vertical line) and
      any such extended matrix into a system of equations. The
      columns represent the hidden variables. In the examples above,
      the first column is the <m>x</m> column; the second
      is the <m>y</m> column; the third is the <m>z</m> column; and
      the column after the vertical line is the column of constants.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-row-operations">
    <title>Row Operations and Gaussian Elimination</title>
    <p>
      I defined three operations on systems of equations. Now that
      I have encoded systems as matrices, I need to understand the
      equivalent operations for matrices. Each equation in the system
      gives a row in the matrix; therefore, equation operations become
      row operations.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Multiply an equation by a non-zero constant
            <m>\implies</m> multiply a row by a non-zero constant.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Change the order of the equations
            <m>\implies</m> exchange two rows of a matrix.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Add (a multiple of) an equation to another equation
            <m>\implies</m>add (a multiple of) one row to another row.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the original operations didn't change the solution of a
      system of equations, the row operations on matrices also
      preserve the solution of the associated system.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, I need to know what a solution looks like in
      matrix form.

        <p>
          The system has three columns before its vertical line;
          therefore it corresponds to a system of equations in
          <m>x,y,z</m>. If I translate this back into equations, I
          get the following system.
          <md>

          Removing the zero terms gives <m>x=-3</m>, <m>y=-2</m> and

          no work is necessary. I just read the solution off the
          page.

          A matrix is a <term>reduced row-echelon</term> matrix or is

          following things are true:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                The first non-zero entry in each row is one. (A row
                entirely of zeros is fine). These entries are called
                <term>leading ones</term>.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Each leading one is in a column where all the other

      As long as an extended matrix is in reduced row-echelon form, I
      can always directly read off the solution to the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing how to recognize solutions in matrix form and knowing
      the row operations, I can now describe the full matrix-based
      approach to solving linear systems. First, I translate a system
      into a matrix. Then, I use row operations (which don't change
      the solution at all) to turn the matrix into reduced row-echelon
      form, where I can just read off the solution. Row operations
      will always be able to accomplish this.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The process of using row operations to change a matrix into
          reduced row-echelon form is called <term>Gaussian
          elimination</term> or <term>row reduction</term>. This
          process proceeds in the following steps.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Choose a row that has a non-zero entry in the first
                column. (Often, I exchange this row with the first so
                that I am working on the first row).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Multiply by a constant to get a leading one in the
                chosen row.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Now that there is a leading one, I want to clear all
                the other entries in the column containing that
                leading one. Therefore, I
                add multiples of the row with the leading one to the
                other rows, one by one, to make those column
                entries zero.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The steps so far produce a column with a leading one
                in the first column and sets all other first column
                entries to zero.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Then I proceed to the next column and repeat the
                process all over again. Any column, which is all zeros
                is skipped. 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The process stops when every row either starts with a
                leading one or is a row entirely of zeros. 
              </p>

    of these leading ones. Here is a definition that does this.

          Then I will row reduce. For the examples here, I'm going to
          be very explicit and show each little step. (As I do more
          and more row reductions, this level of detail will be
          unnecessary.) There is already a leading one in the first
          row, so I try to clear its column. There is a three below
          it. To remove that three, I subtract three times the first
          row from the second.

            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}

            \end{array} \right) 
          </me>
          Then the first column is finished. Now I want a leading one
          in the second row. To get this, I'll exchange the second and
          third rows.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 4 \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp -5 \amp -3 \\
              0 \amp -1 \amp -1 \amp -12 
            \end{array} \right) 
          </me>
          Then I have a leading one in the second row. I want to clear
          its column. There is already a zero above, but I need to
          clear the <m>-1</m> below. To do that, I add the second row
          to the third.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 4 \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp -5 \amp -3 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp -6 \amp -15 
            \end{array} \right) 
          </me>
          That finishes the second column. Now I want a leading one
          in the third row. To get that, I divide the third row by
          <m>-6</m>.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 4 \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp -5 \amp -3 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{5}{2}
            \end{array} \right) 
          </me>
          Then I need to clear the column above this leading one. I
          first subtract the third row from the first row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp \frac{3}{2} \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp -5 \amp -3 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{5}{2}
            \end{array} \right) 
          </me>
          Then I add <m>5</m> times the third row to the second.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp \frac{3}{2} \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{19}{2} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{5}{2}
            \end{array} \right) 
          </me>
          The matrix is now in reduced row-echelon form and I can read
          off the unique solution.

          I turn the system to a matrix.

            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          I want to make a leading one in the first row, so I divide
          the first row by <m>2</m>.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp \frac{1}{2} \amp \frac{-3}{2} \amp \frac{1}{2} \\

              -3 \amp -3 \amp 2 \amp 0 
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Then I want to clear the column under this leading one. I
          start by subtracting <m>4</m> times the first row from the
          second row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp \frac{1}{2} \amp \frac{-3}{2} \amp \frac{1}{2} \\
              0 \amp -2 \amp 7 \amp 5  \\
              -3 \amp -3 \amp 2 \amp 0 
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Then I add <m>3</m> times the first row to the third row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp \frac{1}{2} \amp \frac{-3}{2} \amp \frac{1}{2} \\
              0 \amp -2 \amp 7 \amp 5  \\
              0 \amp \frac{-3}{2} \amp \frac{-5}{2} \amp \frac{3}{2}  
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          That finishes the first column. Next, I want a leading one
          in the second row. To get that, I divide the second row by
          <m>-2</m>. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp \frac{1}{2} \amp \frac{-3}{2} \amp \frac{1}{2} \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{-7}{2} \amp \frac{-5}{2}  \\
              0 \amp \frac{-3}{2} \amp \frac{-5}{2} \amp \frac{3}{2}  
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Then I want to clear the column above and below this leading
          one. First, I'll subtract <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> times the
          second row from the first row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{1}{4} \amp \frac{7}{4} \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{-7}{2} \amp \frac{-5}{2}  \\
              0 \amp \frac{-3}{2} \amp \frac{-5}{2} \amp \frac{3}{2}  
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Then I'll add <m>\frac{3}{2}</m> times the second row to the
          third row.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{1}{4} \amp \frac{7}{4} \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{-7}{2} \amp \frac{-5}{2}  \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp \frac{-31}{4} \amp \frac{-9}{4}  
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          That finishes the second column. Now I need a leading one in
          the third row. To get that, I'll divide the third row by
          <m>\frac{-31}{4}</m>.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{1}{4} \amp \frac{7}{4} \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{-7}{2} \amp \frac{-5}{2}  \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{9}{31}  
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Now I need to clear the column above the leading one. (The
          arithmetic is starting to get pretty annoying here, but I
          will press on. I made good use of a computer algebra system
          to do the fraction arithmetic for me.) First, I subtract
          <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> times the third row from the first row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp \frac{52}{31} \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{-7}{2} \amp \frac{-5}{2}  \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{9}{31}  
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Then I add <m>\frac{7}{2}</m> times the third row to the
          second row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp \frac{52}{31} \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{-46}{31}  \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{9}{31}  
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          This is the reduced row echelon form. Now I can read off the
          solution.

          </me>
          Then I want to row reduce this. I start by interchanging
          rows one and two, to get a leading one in the first row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}

          </me>
          Then I want to clear the column below the leading one. I
          subtract <m>2</m> times the first row from the second.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}

          Then I subtract <m>5</m> times the first row from the third

            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Immediately, I notice something odd. I can subtract the
          second row from the third to clear it entirely.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}

            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Then I can keep going, by dividing the second row by
          <m>-14</m>.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}

            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Then I need to clear above this new leading one. I subtract
          <m>4</m> times the second row from the first row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}

            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          This matrix is now in reduced row-echelon form. There is
          nothing more to be done. However, reading off the solution
          isn't as obvious in this case. I will go over this kind of 
          solution in the next section of the notes.
