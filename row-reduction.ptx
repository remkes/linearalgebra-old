    <title>System of Linear Equations</title>
    <p>
      The previous eight chapters introduced the geometric side of
      this course. This chapter changes perspective to look at the
      algebraic side of linear algebra. A major problem in algebra is
      solving systems of equations: given several equations in several
      variables, can we find values for each variable which satisfy
      all the equations? In general, algegra considers any kind of
      equation.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <md>
          <mrow>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \amp = 3</mrow>
          <mrow>xy + 2xz - 3yz \amp = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>x+y+z \amp = 3</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
          This system is solved by <m>\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z
          \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
          </m> When substitued in the equations, these values satisfy
          all three. No other triples satisfies, so this is a unique
          solution.

      Solving arbitrary systems of equations is a very difficult
      problem. There are two initial techniques, which are usually
      taught in high-school mathematics: isolating and replacing
      variables; or performing arithmetic with the equations
      themselves. Both are useful techniques. However, when the
      equations become quite complicated, both methods can fail. In
      that case, solutions to systerms can only be approached with
      approximation methods. The methodology of these approximations
      is a whole branch of mathematics in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are going to restrict ourselves to a class of systems which
      is more approchable: systems of linear equations. Recall the
      definition of a linear equation which we first stated in <xref
      ref="section-loci" />.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a_i</m> and <m>c</m> be real numbers. A <term>linear
          equation</term> in the variables <m>x_1, x_2 \ldots, x_n</m>
          is a equation of the following form.
          <me>
            a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \ldots + a_n x_n = c
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Given a fixed set of variables <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n</m>, we
      want to consider systems of linear equations (and only linear
      equations) in those variables. While much simpler than the
      general case, linear systems are a common and useful type of
      system to consider. Such systems also work well with arithmetic
      solution techniques, since we can add two linear equations
      together and still have a linear equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This turns out to be the key idea: we can do arithmetic with
      linear equations. Specifically, there are three things we can
      do with a system of linear equation. These three techniques
      <em>preserve the solutions</em>, that is, they don't alter the
      values of the variables that solve the system.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Multiple a single equation by a (non-zero) constant.
            (Multiplying both sides of the equation, of course).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Change the order of the equations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Add one equation to another.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we combine the first and third, we could restate the third
      as: add a multiple of one equation to another. In practice, we
      often think of the third operation this way.

      If we worked with the equations directly, we would find, with
      careful application of the three techniques, we could always
      solve linear systems. However, the notation becomes cumbersome
      for large systems. Therefore, we use matrices to encode
      the information in a nicely organized way.

      Consider a general system with <m>m</m> equations in the
      variables <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n</m>, where <m>a_{ij}</m> and

      In this way, we can change any system of linear equations into a
      extended matrix (with one column after the vertical line), and
      any such extended matrix into a system of equations. The
      columns represent the hidden variables. In the examples above,
      we say that the first column is the <m>x</m> column, the second
      is the <m>y</m> column, the third if the <m>z</m> column, and
      the column after the vertical line is the column of constants.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-row-operations">
    <title>Row Operations and Gaussian Elimination</title>
    <p>
      We defined three operations on systems of equations. Now that
      we have encoded systems as matrices, we need to understand the
      equivalent operations for matrices. Each equation in the system
      gives a row in the matrix; therefore, equation operations become
      row operations.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Multiply an equation by a non-zero constant
            <m>\implies</m> multiply a row by a non-zero constant.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Change the order of the equations
            <m>\implies</m> exchange two rows of a matrix.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Add (a multiple of) an equation to another equation
            <m>\implies</m>add (a multiple of) one row to another row.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the original operations didn't change the solution of a
      system of equations, the row operations on matrices also
      preserve the solution of the associated system.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, we need to know what a solution looks like in
      matrix form.

        <p>
          The system has three columns before its vertical line,
          therefore it corresponds to a system of equation in
          <m>x,y,z</m>. If we translate this back into equations, we
          get the following system.
          <md>

          Removing the zero terms gives <m>x=-3</m>, <m>y=-2</m> and
          <m>z=8</m>. This equation delivers its solution directly:
          no work is necessary. We just read the solution off the
          page.

          A matrix is a <term>reduced row-echelon</term> matrix, or is

            <li>
              <p>
                The first non-zero entry in each row is one. (A row
                entirely of zeros is fine). These entries are called
                leading ones.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Each leading one is in a column where all the other

      We shall see that as long as an extended matrix is in reduced
      row-echelon form, we can always directly read off the solution
      to the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing how to recognize solutions in matrix form and knowing
      the row operations, we can now state our matrix-based approach
      to solving linear systems. First, we to translate a system into
      a matrix. We then use row operations (which don't change the
      solution at all) to turn the matrix into reduced row-echelon
      form, where we can just read off the solution. Row operations
      will always be able to accomplish this.

      <statement>
        <p>
          The process of using row operations to change a matrix into
          reduced row echelon form is called <term>Guassian
          elimantion</term> or <term>row reduction</term>. This
          process proceeds in the following steps.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Take a row which has a non-zero entry in the first
                column. (Often we exchange this row with the first, so
                that we are working on the first row).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Multiply by a constant to get a leading one in this
                row.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Now that we have a leading one, we want to clear all
                the other entries in the first column. Thererfore, we
                add multiples of the row with the leading one to the
                other rows, one by one, to make those first column
                entries zero.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                That produces a column with a leading one in the first
                colum and sets all other first column entries zero.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Then we proceed to the next column and repeat the
                process all over again. Any column which is all zeros
                is skipped. Any row which is all zeros is also left
                alone.

    The leading ones are a key feature of the reduced row-echelon
    form. It will be useful in the future to keep track of the number
    of these leading one. We have a definition which does this.

          Then I will row reduce. For the examples here, I'm going to
          be very explicit and show each little step. (As we do more
          and more row reductions, this level of detail is
          unnecessary.) There is already a leading one in the first
          row, so I try to clear its column. There is a three below
          it. To remove that three, I subtract three times the first
          row from the second.

              0 \amp 1 \amp -5 \amp -3 \\
              0 \amp -1 \amp -1 \amp -12 
            \end{array} \right) 
          </me>
          Then I have a leading one in the second row. I want to clear
          its column. There is already a zero above, but I need to
          clear the <m>-1</m> below. To do that, I add the second row
          to the third.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 4 \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp -5 \amp -3 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp -6 \amp -15 
            \end{array} \right) 
          </me>
          That finished the second column. Now I want a leading one
          in the third row. To get that, I divide the third row by
          <m>-6</m>.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 4 \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp -5 \amp -3 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{5}{2}
            \end{array} \right) 
          </me>
          Then I need to clear the colum above this leading one. I
          first subtract the third row from the first row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp \frac{3}{2} \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp -5 \amp -3 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{5}{2}
            \end{array} \right) 
          </me>
          Then I add <m>5</m> times the third row to the second.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp \frac{3}{2} \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{19}{2} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{5}{2}
            \end{array} \right) 
          </me>
          The matrix is now in reduced row echelon form and I can read
          off the unique solution.

          We turn the system to a matrix.

            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          I was to make a leading one in the first row, so I divide
          the first row by <m>2</m>.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp \frac{1}{2} \amp \frac{-3}{2} \amp \frac{1}{2} \\

              -3 \amp -3 \amp 2 \amp 0 
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Then I want to clear the column under this leading one. I
          start by subtracting <m>4</m> times the first row from the
          second row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp \frac{1}{2} \amp \frac{-3}{2} \amp \frac{1}{2} \\
              0 \amp -2 \amp 7 \amp 5  \\
              -3 \amp -3 \amp 2 \amp 0 
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Then I add <m>3</m> times the first row to the third row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp \frac{1}{2} \amp \frac{-3}{2} \amp \frac{1}{2} \\
              0 \amp -2 \amp 7 \amp 5  \\
              0 \amp \frac{-3}{2} \amp \frac{-5}{2} \amp \frac{3}{2}  
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          That finishes the first column. Next, I want a leading one
          in the second row. To get that, I divide the second row by
          <m>-2</m>. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp \frac{1}{2} \amp \frac{-3}{2} \amp \frac{1}{2} \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{-7}{2} \amp \frac{-5}{2}  \\
              0 \amp \frac{-3}{2} \amp \frac{-5}{2} \amp \frac{3}{2}  
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Then I want to clear the column above and below this leading
          one. First, I'll subtract <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> times the
          second row from the first row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{1}{4} \amp \frac{7}{4} \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{-7}{2} \amp \frac{-5}{2}  \\
              0 \amp \frac{-3}{2} \amp \frac{-5}{2} \amp \frac{3}{2}  
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Then I'll add <m>\frac{3}{2}</m> times the second row to the
          third row.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{1}{4} \amp \frac{7}{4} \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{-7}{2} \amp \frac{-5}{2}  \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp \frac{-31}{4} \amp \frac{-9}{4}  
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          That finished the second column. Now I need a leading one in
          the third row. To get that, I'll divide the third row by
          <m>\frac{-31}{4}</m>.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{1}{4} \amp \frac{7}{4} \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{-7}{2} \amp \frac{-5}{2}  \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{9}{31}  
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Now I need to clear the column above the leading one. (The
          arithmetic is starting to get pretty annoying here, but we
          will press on. I made good use of a computer algebra system
          to do the fraction arithmetic for me.) First, I subtract
          <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> times the third row from the first row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp \frac{52}{31} \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{-7}{2} \amp \frac{-5}{2}  \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{9}{31}  
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Then I add <m>\frac{7}{2}</m> times the third row to the
          second row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp \frac{52}{31} \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{-46}{31}  \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{9}{31}  
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Now I can read off the solution.

              5 \amp 6 \amp -5 \amp 3
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Then I want to row reduce this. I start by interchanging
          rows one and two, to get a leading one in the first row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 4 \amp -2 \amp -2 \\

              5 \amp 6 \amp -5 \amp 3
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Then I want to clear the column below the leading one. I
          subtract <m>2</m> times the first row from the second.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 4 \amp -2 \amp -2 \\
              0 \amp -14 \amp 5 \amp 13 \\
              5 \amp 6 \amp -5 \amp 3
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Then I subtract <m>5</m> times the first row from the third
          row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 4 \amp -2 \amp -2 \\
              0 \amp -14 \amp 5 \amp 13 \\
              0 \amp -14 \amp 5 \amp 13
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Immediately, I notice something odd. I can subtract the
          second row from the third to clear it entirely.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 4 \amp -2 \amp -2 \\
              0 \amp -14 \amp 5 \amp 13 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Then I can keep going, by dividing the second row by
          <m>-14</m>.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 4 \amp -2 \amp -2 \\[1em]
              0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{-5}{14} \amp \frac{-13}{14} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          Then I need to clear above this new leading one. I subtract
          <m>4</m> times the second row from the first row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{-24}{7} \amp \frac{-40}{7} \\[1em]
              0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{-5}{14} \amp \frac{-13}{14} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          This matrix is now in reduced row-echelon form. There is
          nothing more to be done. However, reading off the solution
          isn't as obvious in this case. I will go over these
          solutions in the next section.
