          In linear algebra, ordinary numbers (integers, rational
          numbers or real numbers) are called <term>scalars</term>.

        <p>
          A <term>vector</term> is a finite ordered list of scalars.
          Vectors can be written either as columns or rows. If a
          vector is a list of the numbers <m>4</m>, <m>15</m>,
          <m>\pi</m> and <m>-e</m> (in that order), we write the
          vector in one of two ways:
          <md>
           <mrow>
             \amp \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 15 \\ \pi \\ -e \end{pmatrix} 
             \amp \text{or} \amp \amp (4, 15, \pi, -e) \amp
            </mrow>.
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      In this course, we will exclusively use column vectors. In many
      other places, row vectors are common.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer. <term>Real Euclidean
          Space</term> or <term>Cartesian Space</term>, written
          <m>\RR^n</m>, is the set of all vectors of length <m>n</m>
          with real number entries. We write an arbitrary vector with
          coefficients <m>x_i</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{pmatrix}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We say that <m>\RR^n</m> has <term>dimension</term>
          <m>n</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          The scalars <m>x_i</m> in a vector are called the
          <term>entries</term>, <term>coordinates</term> or
          <term>components</term> of that vector. Specifically,
          <m>x_1</m> is the first coordinate, <m>x_2</m> is the second
          coordinate, and so on. For <m>\RR^2</m>, <m>\RR^3</m> and
          <m>\RR^4</m>, we use the letters <m>w,x,y,z</m> instead of
          <m>x_i</m>.

              \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y\\ z \end{pmatrix} \amp \in \RR^3
              \amp \begin{pmatrix} w \\ x\\ y\\ z \end{pmatrix} \amp

          In any <m>\RR^n</m>, the <term>origin</term> is the unique
          point given by a vector of zeros. It is also called the
          <term>zero vector</term>. It is considered the centre point
          of Euclidean space.

      Euclidean space, particularly the plane, is a familiar
      object from high-school mathematics. We usually visualize
      Euclidean space by drawing axes, one in each independent
      perpendicular direction. In this visualization, the vector
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}</m> corresponds to the
      unique point we get moving <m>a</m> units in the direction of
      the <m>x</m> axis and <m>b</m> units in the direction of the
      <m>y</m> axis. <xref ref="figure-points-in-the-cartesian-plane"
      /> shows the location of several points in <m>\RR^2</m>.

      As with <m>\RR^2</m>, the point <m> \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c
      \end{pmatrix} \in \RR^3</m> is the unique point we find by
      moving <m>a</m> units in the <m>x</m> direction, <m>b</m> units
      in the <m>y</m> direction and <m>c</m> units in the <m>z</m>
      direction. When we visualize <m>\RR^2</m>, we conventionally
      write the <m>x</m> axis horizontally, with a positive direction
      to the right, and the <m>y</m> axis vertically, with a positive
      direction upwards. For <m>\RR^3</m>, the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>
      axes form a flat plane, and the <m>z</m> axis extends vertically
      from that plane.

        <p>
          Note that we needed to choose directions for the axes in
          both <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m>. In a visualization of
          Euclidean space, there are no predetermined directions for
          axes. We have to make a choice. This choice of axis
          directions in the visualization of <m>\RR^n</m> is called 
          <term>orientation</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      While we can visualize <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m> relatively
      easily and efficiently, we can't visualize any higher
      <m>\RR^n</m>. However, this doesn't prevent us from working in
      higher dimensions. We need to rely on the algebraic
      descriptions of vectors instead of the drawings and
      visualizations of <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our visualizations of <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m>, we see
      the different axes as fundamentally different perpendicular
      directions. We can think of <m>\RR^2</m> as the space with two
      independent directions and <m>\RR^3</m> as the space with three
      independent directions. Similarly, <m>\RR^4</m> is the space
      with four perpendicular, independent directions, even though it
      is impossible to visualize such a thing. Likewise, <m>\RR^n</m>
      is the space with <m>n</m> independent directions.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-point-or-directions">

    <p>
      We can think of an element of <m>\RR^2</m>, say
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}</m> , as both the point
      located at <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}</m> and the
      vector drawn from the origin to the point <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1
      \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}</m> , as shown in <xref
      ref="figure-points-and-directions" />. Though these two ideas
      are distinct, we will frequently switch between them, often
      without explicitly saying so. Part of becoming proficient in
      vector geometry is becoming accustomed to the switch between the
      perspectives of points and directions.

    <title>Local Direction Vectors</title>
    <p>
      We've already spoken about the distinction between elements of
      <m>\RR^n</m> as points and vectors. There is another important
      subtlety that shows up all throughout vector geometry. In
      addition to thinking of vectors as directions starting at the
      origin, we can think of them as directions starting anywhere in
      <m>\RR^n</m>. We call these local direction vectors.

    <p>
      <xref ref="figure-local-direction-vectors" /> shows local
      direction vectors starting at the point <m>\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\
      2 \end{pmatrix} \in \RR^2</m>. The two local vectors
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}</m> and
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}</m> are relative to
      the point <m>\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \in \RR^2</m>
      as if that were their origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using vectors to define local directions is a 
      useful tool. A standard example is a camera in a three-dimensional 
      virtual environment. First, you need to know the
      location of the camera, which is an ordinary vector starting
      from the origin. Second, you need to know what direction the
      camera is pointing, which is a local direction vector which
      treats the camera location as the current origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most difficult things about learning vector geometry
      is becoming accustomed to local direction vectors. We don't
      always carefully distinguish between vectors at the origin and
      local direction vectors; often, the difference is implied, and it
      is up to the reader/student to figure out how the vectors are
      being used.
