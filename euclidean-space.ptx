          In linear algebra, ordinary numbers (intergers, rational
          numbers or real numbers) are called <term>scalars</term>.

          A <term>vector</term> is a finite ordered list of scalars.
          Vectors can be written either as columns or rows. If a
          vector is a list of the numbers <m>4</m>, <m>15</m>,
          <m>\pi</m> and <m>-e</m> (in that order), we write the
          vector in one of two ways:
          <md>
           <mrow>
             \amp \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 15 \\ \pi \\ -e \end{pmatrix} 
             \amp \text{or} \amp \amp (4, 15, \pi, -e) \amp
            </mrow>.
          </md>
        </p>

      In these notes, we will exclusively use column vectors.

          Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer. <term>Real Euclidean
          Space</term> or <term>Cartesian Space</term>, written
          <m>\RR^n</m>, is the set of all vectors of length <m>n</m>
          with real number entries. In this course, elements of
          <m>\RR^n</m> are written as a column.
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We say that <m>\RR^n</m> has <term>dimension</term>
          <m>n</m>.

          The scalars <m>x_i</m> in a vector are called the
          <term>entries</term>, <term>coordinates</term> or
          <term>components</term> of that vector. Specifically,
          <m>x_1</m> is the first coordinate, <m>x_2</m> is the second
          coordinate, and so on. For <m>\RR^2</m>, <m>\RR^3</m> and
          <m>\RR^4</m>, we use the letters <m>w,x,y,z</m> instead of
          <m>x_i</m>.

          In any <m>\RR^n</m>, the <term>origin</term> is the unique
          point given by a vector of zeros. It is also called the

          of Euclidean space.

      Euclidean space, particularly the plane, is a familiar
      object from high-school mathematics. We usually visualize
      Euclidean space by drawing axes, one in each independent
      perpendicular direction. In this visualization, the vector
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}</m> corresponds to the
      unique point we get moving <m>a</m> units in the direction of
      the <m>x</m> axis and <m>b</m> units in the direction of the
      <m>y</m> axis. <xref ref="figure-points-in-the-cartesian-plane"
      /> shows the location of several points in <m>\RR^2</m>.

      As with <m>\RR^2</m>, the point <m> \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c
      \end{pmatrix} \in \RR^3</m> is the unique point we find by
      moving <m>a</m> units in the <m>x</m> direction, <m>b</m> units
      in the <m>y</m> direction and <m>c</m> units in the <m>z</m>
      direction. When we visualize <m>\RR^2</m>, we conventionally
      write the <m>x</m> axis horizontally, with a positive direction
      to the right, and the <m>y</m> axis vertically, with a positive
      direction upwards. For <m>\RR^3</m>, the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>
      axes form a flat plane and the <m>z</m> axis extend vertically
      from that plan, as shown in <xref
      ref="figure-points-in-three-space" />. Notice, in
      both cases, we needed to choose directions for the axes.

      While we can visualize <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m> relatively
      easily and efficiently, but we can't visualize any higher
      <m>\RR^n</m>. However, this doesn't prevent us from working in
      higher dimensions. We need to rely on the algebraic
      descriptions of vectors instead of the drawings and
      visualizations of <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our visualizations of <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m>, we see
      the different axes as fundementally different perpendicular
      directions. We can think of <m>\RR^2</m> as the space with two
      independent directions and <m>\RR^3</m> as the space with three
      independent directions. Similarly, <m>\RR^4</m> is the space
      with four perpendicular, independent directions, even though it
      is impossible to visualize such a thing. Likewise, <m>\RR^n</m>
      is the space with <m>n</m> independent directions.

    <p>
      We can think of a element of <m>\RR^2</m>, say
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}</m> , as both the point
      located at <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}</m> and the
      vector drawn from the origin to the point <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1
      \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}</m> , as shown in <xref
      ref="figure-points-and-directions" />. Though these two
      ideas are distinct, we will frequently change perspective
      between them. Part of becoming proficient in vector geometry is
      becoming accustomed to the switch between the perspectives of
      points and directions.

    <title>Local Direction Vectors</title>
    <p>
      We've already spoken about the distinction between elements of
      <m>\RR^n</m> as points and vectors. There is another important
      subtlety that shows up all throughout vector geometry. In
      addition to thinking of vectors as directions starting at the
      origin, we can think of them as directions starting anywhere in
      <m>\RR^n</m>. We call these local direction vectors.
    </p>

          label("$\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$",(1,1),SE);
          label("Local $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0
            \end{pmatrix}$",(3,2),S);

      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      For example, as pictured in <xref
      ref="figure-local-direction-vectors" />, at the point
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \in \RR^2</m>, we could
      think of the local directions <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0
      \end{pmatrix}</m> or <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1
      \end{pmatrix}</m>. These are not directions starting from the
      origin, but starting from <m>\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2
      \end{pmatrix}</m> <em>as if that were the origin</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using vectors to define local directions is a particularly
      useful tool. A standard example is camera location in a three
      dimensional virtual environment. First, you need to know the
      location of the camera, which is an ordinary vector starting
      from the origin. Second, you need to know what direction the
      camera is pointing, which is a local direction vector which
      treats the camera location as the current origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most difficult things about learning vector geometry
      is becoming accustomed to local direction vectors. We don't
      always carefully distinguish between vectors at the origin and
      local direction vectors; often, the difference is implied and it
      is up to the reader/student to figure out how the vectors are
      being used.
