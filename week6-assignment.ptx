    <li>
      <p>
        Find a linear transformation of <m>\RR^2</m> for each of the
        following conditions. (Give a reason for each choice; just
        writing down a matrix is not sufficient.) (15)
      </p>
      <p><ol>
        <li>
          A transformation which changes the unit circle into an
          ellipse with major axis <m>4</m> and minor axis <m>2</m>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          A transformation which exchanges the first and third
          quadrants.
        </li>
        <li>
          A transformation that sends <m>\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4
          \end{pmatrix}</m> to <m>\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2
          \end{pmatrix}</m>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          A transformation that turns squares into line segments.
        </li>
        <li>
          A transformation that makes the parallelogram with vertices
          <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}</m>,
          <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}</m>,
          <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}</m>, and
          <m>\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}</m> into a square. 
        </li>
      </ol></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Write the six matrices that exchange any two coordinates in 
      <m>\RR^4</m>. (The standard coordinate names are, of course,
      <m>\{w,x,y,z\}</m>.) Either prove that any two of these matrices
      commute or provide a counter exmaple to show that they do not
      commute. (You do not need to do all 60 possible matrix
      calculations. If you are finding a counter example, just one
      counter example is sufficient. If you are supplying a proof, you
      can make an conceptual argument based on what the
      transformations do and how that interacts with composition.) (6)
