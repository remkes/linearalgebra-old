    <li>
      <p>
        Find a linear transformation of <m>\RR^2</m> for each of the
        following conditions. (Give a reason for each choice; just
        writing down a matrix is not sufficient.) (15)
      </p>
      <p><ol>
        <li>
          A transformation sends a circle of radius <m>4</m> to a
          circle of radius <m>7</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          A transformation that preserves both axes.
        </li>
        <li>
          A transformation that sends <m>\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ -3
          \end{pmatrix}</m> to the origin.
        </li>
        <li>
          A transformation that preserves an octagon but is
          non-trivial.
        </li>
        <li>
          A transformation that exchanges <m>\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 
          1 \end{pmatrix}</m> and <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 
          \end{pmatrix}</m>.
        </li>
      </ol></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      In <m>\RR^4</m> with variable order <m>w, x, y, z</m>, write a
      matrix which represents rotation by <m>\frac{\pi}{4}</m>
      radians in the <m>xy</m> plane, scalaing by <m>4</m> in the
      <m>w</m> axis and scaling by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> in the
      <m>z</m> axis. (4) 
    </li>
    <li>
      Write the matrices for projection onto each axis in
      <m>\RR^3</m>. Show that any two of these compose to make the
      zero matrix. (6) 
    </li>
