  <title>Dimensions of Loci</title>
    <p>
      As with spans, I can use row-reduction of matrices to find the
      dimensions of a locus. In particular, I will be able to
      determine if any of the equations were redundant. Recall that
      I described any affine or linear subspace of <m>\RR^n</m> as
      the locus of some finite number of linear equations: the set of
      points that satisfy a list of equations.

      This is just a system of linear equations, which has a
      corresponding matrix.

        \left( \begin{array}{cccc|c} 
          a_{11} \amp a_{12} \amp \ldots \amp a_{1n} \amp c_1 \\ 
          a_{21} \amp a_{22} \amp \ldots \amp a_{2n} \amp c_2 \\ 
          \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \ldots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \\ 
          a_{11} \amp a_{12} \amp \ldots \amp a_{1n} \amp c_1 
        \end{array} \right)

      So, by definition, the locus of a set of linear equations is just
      the geometric version of the solution space of the system of
      linear equations. Loci and solution spaces are exactly the
      same things; only loci are geometry, and solution spaces are
      algebra. The dimension of a locus is the same dimension as a
      solution space of a system. In <xref
      ref="section-description-by-parameters" />, the dimension of a
      solution space was determined by the free variables in the
      reduced form of the matrix. Let me restate the result. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider a locus defined by a set of linear equations. Then
          the dimension of the locus is the number of free variables
          in the solution space of the matrix corresponding to the
          system of the equations. If the matrix contains a row that
          leads to a contradiction <m>0=1</m>, then the locus is
          empty.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      To understand a locus, I just solve the associated system. If
      it has solutions, I count the free variables: that's the
      dimension of the locus. I can get even more information from
      this process.  When I row reduce the matrix <m>A</m>
      corresponding to the linear system, the equations corresponding
      to rows with leading ones (keeping track of exchanging rows, if
      necessary) are equations that are necessary to define the
      locus. Those that end up as rows without leading ones are
      redundant, and the locus is unchanged if those equations are
      removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the ambient space is <m>\RR^n</m>, then the equations have
      <m>n</m> variables. That is, there are <m>n</m> columns to the
      left of the vertical line in the extended matrix. If the rank
      of <m>A</m> is <m>k</m>, and there are no rows that reduce to
      <m>0=1</m>, then there will be <m>n-k</m> columns without
      leading ones, so <m>n-k</m> free variables. The dimension of
      the locus is the ambient dimension <m>n</m> minus the rank of
      the matrix <m>k</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fits the intuition for spans and loci. Spans are built up:
      their dimension is equal to the rank of an associated matrix
      since each leading one corresponds to a unique direction in the
      span, adding to the dimension by one. Loci are restrictions down
      from the total space: their dimension is the ambient dimension
      minus the rank of an associated matrix, since each leading one
      corresponds to a real restriction on the locus, dropping the
      dimensions by one. In either case, the question of calculating
      dimension boils down to the rank of an associated matrix.

        <p>
          I'm going to repeat material <xref
          ref="example-description-by-parameters" /> to make the point
          that nothing new is happening here: I'm just treating
          loci as linear systems and looking at their solutions
          spaces. Consider a locus in <m>\RR^4</m> defined by two
          equations.

            <mrow>
              w + 3y + 2z \amp = -3 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              x - y - z \amp = -2 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          The translation of this into a matrix is precisely the
          matrix in <xref ref="example-description-by-parameters" />.
          <me>
            \left(\begin{array}{cccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 3 \amp 2 \amp -3 \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp -1 \amp -1 \amp -2 
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          The equation is already in reduced row-echolon form. There
          are two columns (other than the constant column) without
          leading ones; therefore <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> are free
          variables. The solution, in a description with free
          parameters, is
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix} w \\ x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} =
            \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + y
            \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + z
            \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an affine subspace with dimension <m>2</m>. The number
          of variables (<m>4</m>) minus the rank of the matrix
          (<m>2</m>) also confirms this dimension.
