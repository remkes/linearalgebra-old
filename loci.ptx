    <title>Dot Products and Loci</title>
    <p>
      Having discussed spans, let's return to loci. By re-examing the
      linear equations, we can define loci via dot products. Consider,
      again, the general linear equation in <m>\RR^n</m>.
      <me>
        a_1 u_1 + a_2 u_2 + \ldots + a_n u_n = c
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's think of the variables <m>u_i</m> as the components of a
      vector <m>u \in \RR^n</m>. We also have <m>n</m> scalars
      <m>a_i</m> which we likewise treat as a components of the vector
      <m>a \in \RR^n</m>. The vector <m>u</m> is variables, the
      vector <m>a</m> is constant. Then we can re-write the linear
      equation using these two vectors.
      <me>
        a_1 u_1 + a_2 u_2 + \ldots + a_n u_n = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\
        a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} u_1
        \\ u_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n \end{pmatrix} = a \cdot u = c
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, a linear equation specifies that the dot product
      result of a variables vector <m>u</m> with a fixed vector
      <m>a</m> must have the result <m>c</m>. In this light, an
      affine plane in <m>\RR^3</m> is given by the equation
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} \cdot
      \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix} = c</m> . This
      plane is precisely all vectors whose dot product with the vector
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}</m> is the
      fixed number <m>c</m>. If <m>c=0</m>, then we get
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} \cdot
      \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix} = 0</m> . A
      linear plane is the set of all vectors which are perpendicular
      to a fixed vector <m>\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3
      \end{pmatrix}</m>.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>P</m> be a plane in <m>\RR^3</m> determined by the
          equation <m>\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} \cdot
          \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix} = c</m> .
          The vector <m>\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3
          \end{pmatrix}</m> is called the <term>normal to the
          plane</term>. Let <m>H</m> be a hyperplane in <m>\RR^n</m>
          determined by the equivalent equation in <m>\RR^n</m>.
          <me>
            u \cdot a = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n
            \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots
            \\ a_n \end{pmatrix} = c
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The vector <m>a</m> is called the <term>normal to the
          hyperplane</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If <m>c=0</m>, the plane or hyperplane is perpendicular to its
      normal. This notion of orthogonality still works when <m>c \neq
      0</m>. In this case, the normal is a <em>local</em>
      perpendicular direction from any point on the affine plane.
      Treating any such point as a local origin, the normal points in
      a direction perpendicular to all the <em>local direction</em>
      vectors which lie on the plane.

      Now we can build a general process for finding the equation of a
      plane in <m>\RR^3</m>. Any time we have a point <m>p</m> on the
      plane and two <em>local direction vectors</em> <m>u</m> and
      <m>v</m> which remain on the plane, we can find a normal to the
      plane by taking <m>u \times v</m>. Then we can find the
      equation of the plane by taking the dot product <m>p \cdot (u
      \times v)</m> to find the constant <m>c</m>.
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} \cdot (u \times v) =
        c
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we are given three points on a plane (<m>p</m>, <m>q</m> and
      <m>r</m>), then we can use <m>p</m> as the local origin and
      construct the local direction vectors as <m>q-p</m> and
      <m>r-p</m>. The normal is <m>(q-p) \times (r-p)</m>. In this
      way, we can construct the equation of a plane given three points
      or a single point and two local directions.
