    <title>General Properties of the Matrix Action</title>
    <p>
      I have defined linear transformation. At this point, I could
      state and try to prove a variety of properties about linear
      transformations and their matrix representations. Most
      obviously, perhaps, I could prove that the matrix action is
      actually a linear transformation, as I stated in <xref
      ref="section-matrices-and-transformations" />, and the converse
      that all linear transformations can be represented as matrices. 
      I could also prove the two properties in <xref
      ref="proposition-matrix-multiplication" />. I am opting not to
      present these general proofs. They are not conceptually
      difficult, but to do them in general is notationally difficult.
      It involves a lot of matrix coefficients, vector coefficients
      and many subscripts. I thought to include those proofs here
      wasn't useful for building up our experience with proofs (other
      than perhaps to show that notation is a major challenge in
      writing mathematical proof).

    <title>Properties of Transformations in <m>\RR^2</m></title>
    <p>
      Instead of proving the most general statements about matrix
      transformations, I'll prove some more specific statements about
      the types of transformations I defined in <xref
      ref="section-r2-examples" />. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        Any two reflections in <m>\RR^2</m> commute. 
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          To commute means that if the order of the composition (or
          matrix multiplication) is reverse, the outcome is the same.
          That is, if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are the matrix
          representations of two reflections, then <m>AB = BA</m> is a
          true statement about matrix multiplication. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I want my proof to be completely general, so I want to work
          with arbitrary reflections. Let's say that <m>A</m> is a
          reflection by the angle <m>\theta</m>, so it has the matrix
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix}
              \cos \theta \amp - \sin \theta \\
              \sin \theta \amp \cos \theta
            \end{pmatrix}
          </me>.
          Let's also say that <m>B</m> is a reflection by the angle
          <m>\phi</m>, so it has the matrix. 
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix}
              \cos \phi \amp - \sin \phi \\
              \sin \phi \amp \cos \phi
            \end{pmatrix}
          </me>.
          Now I need to calculate the two matrix multiplications and
          show that the result is the same regardless of the order.
          First I will calculate <m>AB</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              AB \amp = \begin{pmatrix}
                \cos \theta \amp - \sin \theta \\
                \sin \theta \amp \cos \theta
              \end{pmatrix}
              \begin{pmatrix}
                \cos \phi \amp - \sin \phi \\
                \sin \phi \amp \cos \phi
              \end{pmatrix} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \begin{pmatrix}
                \cos \theta \cos \phi - \sin \theta \sin \phi \amp 
                -\cos \theta \sin \phi - \sin \theta \cos \phi \\ 
                \sin \theta \cos \phi + \cos \theta \sin \phi \amp 
                -\sin \theta \sin \phi + \cos \theta \cos \phi 
              \end{pmatrix} 
            </mrow>
          </md>.
          Now I'll do the other order of the multiplication.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              BA \amp = \begin{pmatrix}
                \cos \phi \amp - \sin \phi \\
                \sin \phi \amp \cos \phi
              \end{pmatrix}
              \begin{pmatrix}
                \cos \theta \amp - \sin \theta \\
                \sin \theta \amp \cos \theta
              \end{pmatrix} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \begin{pmatrix}
                \cos \phi \cos \theta - \sin \phi \sin \theta \amp 
                - \cos \phi \sin \theta - \sin \phi \cos \theta \\ 
                \sin \phi \cos \theta + \cos \phi \sin \theta \amp 
                -\sin \phi \sin \theta + \cos \phi \cos \theta
              \end{pmatrix} 
            </mrow>
          </md>.
          I  can take this second result and switch the order of all the
          multiplications (which is valid since there are just
          multiplications of ordinary numbers). I can also reorder a
          couple of the additions/subtractions.
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix}
              \cos \theta \cos \phi - \sin \theta \sin \phi \amp 
              - \cos \theta \sin \phi - \sin \theta \cos \phi \\ 
              \sin \theta \cos \phi + \cos \theta \sin \phi \amp 
              -\sin \theta \sin \phi + \cos \theta \cos \phi
            \end{pmatrix} 
          </me>.
          This is the same as the result of <m>AB</m>. That conclude
          the proof, showing that the outcome of either order of
          matrix multiplication is the same.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      You might woner, at this point, about the structure of this
      proof. I've tried to say several times that to prove an
      equality, we need to start at one side and end at the other.
      However, here I've tried to prove <m>AB=BA</m> and done so by
      reducing to a common form. Am I disobeying my own rules?
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not contradicting myself, though it is a very good
      question. To understand why, look at the statement of the
      proposition. Composition of transformation is a process where
      two transformations combine into one new one. There are two ways
      to do it: <m>AB</m> or <m>BA</m>. The proposition says that the
      outcome of both orders is the same. Therefore, I can calculate
      the outcome of both orders and compare them. This is different
      from a proposition that simply states an equation; for these
      proposition, reducing each side of the equation to a common
      expression can result in a false proof (for example, by
      muliptlying both sides by zero). Here, I'm not reducing an
      equation to a common form, but doing two processes and comparing
      the result. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        Prove that a projection in <m>\RR^2</m> composed with itself
        is just the same projection. (That is, for any projection
        <m>A</m>, <m>AA = A</m>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        All we need to do for this proof is take the general matrix
        for a projection and multiply it by itself. The general matrix
        is
        <me>
          A = \begin{pmatrix}
            a^2 \amp ab \\
            ab \amp b^2 
          \end{pmatrix} 
        </me>,
        remembering that this is for a unit vector direction. Since we
        have a unit vector direction, <m>a^2 + b^2 = 1</m>, which we
        will ned for this proof. Now let's take this matrix and
        muliptly it by itself.
        <me>
          A^2 = \begin{pmatrix}
            a^2 \amp ab \\
            ab \amp b^2 
          \end{pmatrix} 
          \begin{pmatrix}
            a^2 \amp ab \\
            ab \amp b^2 
          \end{pmatrix}  =
          \begin{pmatrix}
            (a^2)(a^2) + (ab)(ab) \amp 
            (a^2)(ab) + (ab)(b^2) \\
            (ab)(a^2) + (b^2)(ab) \amp
            (ab)(ab) + (b^2)(b^2)
          \end{pmatrix}
        </me>
        In each component of this matrix, I can factor out <m>a^2</m>,
        <m>b^2</m>, or <m>ab</m>. 
        <me>
          = \begin{pmatrix}
            a^2(a^2 + b^2) \amp 
            ab(a^2 + b^2) \\
            ab(a^2) + b^2) \amp
            b^2(a^2 + b^2)
          \end{pmatrix}
        </me>
        Then I can use the fact that <m>a^2 + b^2 = 1</m>.
        <me>
          = \begin{pmatrix}
            a^2 \amp ab \\ 
            ab \amp b^2 
          \end{pmatrix} = A 
        </me>
        This is the same as the starting matrix. I've proved that
        <m>AA=A</m>, which was the goal of the proposition.
      </proof>
    </proposition>
