    <title>Age-Structured Populations</title>
    <p>
      One of the starting points of mathematical biology is the study
      of population growth. Though many of the most interesting
      systems involve multiple species with various interactions
      (symbiotic, competition, predator-prey, etc.), the theory starts
      with single-species dynamics. How does a species grow or decline
      when considered by itself? For those who've taken calculus with
      me, I used population growth as a major motivator for that
      course, working with the differential equations that describe
      exponential and logistic growth. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes I want to know more details about the population than
      simply the count of its members. One way of describing a
      population is by age categories; this is called an
      age-structured population. This is pretty common in human
      geography, where the population of a country (or other human
      groups) is given in ten-year increments. (Usually, these graphs
      are segregated by sex as well.) This can also be very useful in
      animal populations since there are often important age-defined
      subsets that control the growth or decline of a population. In
      conservation biology, resources can be much more carefully used
      if a model can focus on a specific age category in a
      population.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the simplest single-species models, there is a birth
      and death rate. For an age-structured population, the situation
      is more complicated. Instead of just asking for the death rate, I
      now need to know the survival rate from each age category to the
      next (assuming that no one survives from the oldest age
      category). If there are <m>n</m> age categories, that's
      <m>(n-1)</m> survival rates (again, excluding the oldest age
      category). Likewise, instead of a generic birth rate, I need to
      know the birth rate due to each age category. These are called
      fecundity rates. There may be fewer of these (or, rather, some
      might be set to zero) since only certain age categories may be
      fertile, But again, in theory, I have up to <m>n</m> new
      rates.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do I track all this information? I can do it with the
      dynamical system described in the next section.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-leslie-definition">
    <title>Leslie Matrices</title>
    <p>
      A Leslie matrices is a dynamical system that models
      an age-structured population. To demonstrate, I'll
      assume there are four age categories. The state vector
      <m>v_k</m> is the current population in each age category: so
      that <m>v_1</m> is the population of the youngest category,
      <m>v_2</m> of the next, <m>v_3</m> of the next, and finally
      <m>v_4</m> of the oldest category. The matrix <m>C</m>, called a
      Leslie matrix, is a <m>4 \times 4</m> matrix, and the action of a
      matrix (like for all dynamical systems) takes a state vector and
      moves it ahead by one time step. If I use coordinates
      <m>w,x,y,z</m> in <m>\RR^4</m>, here is the dynamical system.
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix} 
          w_{k+1} \\ x_{k+1} \\ y_{k+1} \\ z_{k+1}
        \end{pmatrix} = 
        \begin{pmatrix} 
          f_1 \amp  f_2 \amp  f_3 \amp f_4 \\ 
          s_1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 
          0 \amp s_2 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 
          0 \amp  0 \amp s_3 \amp  0 
        \end{pmatrix} 
        \begin{pmatrix} 
          w_k \\ x_k \\ y_k \\ z_k 
        \end{pmatrix}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine of the entries must be set to zero, since they are age
      categories that cannot transfer to other age categories in one
      time step (i.e., something in age category 1 cannot jump directly
      to age category 4, nor can something in the 3rd age category
      suddenly get younger and move into the 2nd age category). I want
      to interpret the remaining 7 non-zero entries. The first row
      outputs to the first category, representing the creation of new
      members of the population. Each <m>f_i</m> is the
      <em>fecundity</em> of each population state: its rate of
      producing offspring. Of course, some of these might be zero if
      only certain age categories produce offspring. The <m>s_i</m>,
      on the other hand, are transitions from one age category to the
      next. These are <em>survival rates</em>: <m>s_1</m> is the rate
      of survival from category <m>1</m> to category <m>2</m>,
      <m>s_2</m> from category <m>2</m> to <m>3</m> and <m>s_3</m>
      from category <m>3</m> to <m>4</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Leslie matrices are irreducible (recall that irreducible
      meant that each state connects to the other; by survival and
      fertility, it is possible to pass from any age category to another
      over several years). This means that there is a unique largest
      eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> with a positive eigenvector. This is
      the value I care about: in the long run, the largest eigenvalue
      dominates, and its eigenvector gives the stable age distribution.
      If <m>\lambda = 1</m>, I expect a stable population. If
      <m>\lambda > 1</m>, I expect exponential growth, and if
      <m>\lambda \lt 1</m>, I expect exponential decay. In addition,
      I can look for the limit of the ratios between the age
      categories. As the population either grows or decays, those
      ratios will approach fixed values, which are represented by the
      eigenvector matching the dominant eigenvalue.

      All these examples will be four-stage population models, using
      the description as above. For each, I will determine the long
      term behaviour by analyzing the dominant eigenvalue and its
      matching eigenvector.

          The popluation is not viable, since the dominant eigenvalue
          is less than 1; the population will decay. The age ratios

          </md>
          The population is viable; since the dominant eigenvalue is
          larger than one, the population will grow. The age ratios
          will approach <m>2.15: 1.68:1.49:1</m>. Compared with the
          previous example, two coefficients have been changed: the
          fecundity coefficient of the 3rd age category and the
          survival coefficient from the 2nd to the 3rd age category.
          These were both increased sufficiently to change the non-viable
          population into a viable population.

          This is a viable population; since the dominant eigenvalue
          is positive, this population will grow. That said, since the
          dominant eigenvalue is only slightly above 1, the population
          growth will be relatively slow. As the population grows, the
          age ratios will approach <m>3.21:1.27:1.16:1</m>.

          </md>
          The population is viable, since the dominant eigenvalue is
          larger than 1. In addition, this is quite a fast growth
          rate, since the eigenvalue is significantly above one. The
          age ratios will approach <m>196.37:3.50:1.87:1</m>. Note
          that these ratios are quite different from previous

          </md>
          The population is not viable, since the dominant eigenvalue

          <m>89.012:0.993:0.993:1</m>. Compared to the previous example,
          the viable population has now become non-variable. The only
          coefficient that has changed is the survival coefficient
          from the 1st to the 2nd age category. Previously, 3% of the
          youngest survived for a time interval. Now, only 1% survive.
          That change is significant enough to drop the population
          from viable to non-viable.
