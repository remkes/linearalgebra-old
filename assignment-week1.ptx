        An ellipse is determined by a centre point, a greatest
        distance to the edge <m>a</m> in some direction and a least
        distance to the edge <m>b</m> in the perpendicular direction
        to the first. This produces an oval shape <mdash /> a circle
        if the two distances are the same. If the centre is the
        origin, the large distance is along the <m>x</m> axis, and the
        small distance is along the <m>y</m> axis, then the equation
        of the ellipse is 
        <me>
          \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 
        </me>.
        How does the ellipse generalize to <m>\RR^3</m>, <m>\RR^4</m>
        and higher dimensional spaces? How much information is needed
        to determine the object (how many constants like the numbers
        <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>)? (4)

      <p>
        How many vertices does the <m>n</m>-dimensional cube have?
        (Make sure you give your reasoning based on the construction
        of these cubes described in the videos and notes.) (4)

      <p>
        Prove that vector addition is associative. (I said in the
        notes that this is very similar to the proof for
        commutativity. You can follow the structure of that proof).
