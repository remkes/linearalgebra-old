    <title>What Is A Proof?</title>
    <p>
      In the sequence of math courses that are offered at King's, 
      linear algebra is the most natural place to start talking about
      mathematical proofs. The material lends itself to a number of
      accessible proof examples and have a level of abstraction that
      suits proof questions. The linear algebra course also serves as
      a prerequisite for most of the other mathematic courses where
      proof becomes quite important, including the senior calculus
      courses, discrete mathematics, cryptography and theory of
      computing. 
    </p>
    <p>
      So what is a mathematical proof? A simple definition is hard,
      but my best attempt is very general: a proof is a formal,
      logical, mathematical argument that succeeds in convincing an
      informed reader. Let me talk through this definition.
      <ul>
        <li>
          First, a proof is an argument. It is persuasive: it has a
          proposition, and it wants to convince its reader that the
          proposition is true. In this, it shares something with all
          the other persuasive writing through university,
          including scientific studies, aesthetic critiques, and
          persuasive essays.
        </li>
        <li>
          Second, a proof is logical. Though mathematical discovery can
          happen in a variety of ways, the presentation of
          mathematical ideas happen through logic. A proof will be a
          series of logical statements and implications. If
          successful, the chain of logic will lead from the
          assumptions of the proof to the desired conclusion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Third, a proof is formal. Mathematics has formal
          notations, definitions, and rules for manipulating
          expressions. A proof follows these formalities. It can't
          treat mathematical ideas and definitions loosely or casually;
          <emdash /> it has to follow the rules and strict conventions
          of mathematics.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, it succeeds in convincing the reader. At the end of
          a proof, the question should always be: are you convinced?
          Proofs are accepted by the mathematical community when a
          sufficient number of qualified readers are convinced by the
          mathematical formality and logical sequence. In this course,
          when I present a proof, I will try to repeatedly ask if you
          are convinced by the proof. If you are not, either the proof
          is flawed, or your understanding of the argument is weak
          and you need to go back and study the assumptions,
          notations, and structure more carefully.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <title>How to Write a Proof</title>
      <p>
        I desperately wish there were something simple and
        straightforward I could say here about how to write a proof. I
        wish I could give you a reasonable three-step process 
        that would always produce good proofs.
        Unfortunately, no such thing exists. Writing proofs is the
        most difficult skill in mathematics. Writing a good proof is
        comparable to writing a good essay. I learn by reading good
        examples, practicing my own, and being patient with the long
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this course, I'm not going to give you any short, easy
        method for writing proofs (since, as I just said, no such
        method exists). Instead, I'm going to try to start the process
        of exposing you to proofs. In many ways, learning to write
        proofs is done by example <mdash /> by reading lots of proofs and
        seeing how they work. I'll show you a bunch of short proofs in
        this course and ask you to try to emulate them in 
        the activities and assignments.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, I will give some pointers and ideas on how to
        start. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Remember that a proof is a chain of logical arguments. You
          should see this structure in the proofs you write. Look out
          for any sudden jumps or gaps in the logic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use your starting assumptions. If you are proving something
          about a prime number, but never use the fact that it is
          prime, something very strange is going on. Either you are
          making a mistake, or the assumption that the number is prime
          is unnecessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't assume what you are trying to prove. The statement
          that you want to prove should show up at the very end of
          your proof. You can't start with the statement you want to
          prove <mdash /> logical implications don't work that way.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a huge difference between the rough work that goes
          into sketching a proof and the final proof. In the rough
          work, I will often start with the conclusion and make various 
          attempts to see how I might get there. I try things, play
          around with ideas, do test cases. But when I write up a
          proof, I take all this rough work and try to put it into
          a formal logical chain with the desired statement coming at
          the end, as a conclusion.
        </li>
        <li>
          A good proof includes good writing as well as good
          mathematics. Write clear, complete sentences. Treat proof-writing 
          with the same level of care as you would any
          academic writing. 
        </li>
        <li>
          There are a number of special proof techniques that are
          worth some attention. I'll spend the next section on two of
          these techniques. Not all proofs need a named technique, 
          but these two are common enough to point out at the
          start. 
        </li>
      </ul>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml-id="subsection-contradiction">
    <title>Proof by Contradiction</title>
    <p>
      There are many common structures and techniques used with proofs.
      I'm going to share with you two of the most common techniques.
      The first is proof by contradiction. This technique relies on the
      assumption that any (well-formed) statement in mathematics is
      either true or false. To prove a statement is true, I can
      equivalently show that it is impossible for the statement to be
      false. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To prove by contradiction, I assume the statement I want to
      prove is false. Then, starting from that assumption, I make
      logical conclusions. These logical conclusions lead me to an
      impossible situation <mdash /> a contradiction. This
      contradiction can take many forms: a contradiction of some 
      statement I know is true, an impossibility of a statement
      being both true and false, or some other situation which cannot
      make sense. Since I end up with this contradiction, my
      original assumption must have been wrong. Since I assumed
      the statement was false, the statement must therefore be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is perhaps easier to see in an example. I'll do two
      examples, both of which are classic proof examples. First, I'll
      prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Step 1: Assume the statement is false. The statement
        says there are infinitely many prime numbers. If that is
        false, there must be only finitely many prime numbers. So my
        assumption is that there are finitely many prime numbers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 2: Work from the assumption to build a contradiction. The
        assumption says that there are finitely many prime numbers.
        Since there are only finitely many, I can index them: <m>p_1,
        p_2, p_3, \ldots p_k</m>. This is a finite list of some
        length <m>k</m>. Then consider a very large number formed by
        multiplying these all together and adding 1. 
        <me>
          m = p_1p_2 \ldots p_k + 1 
        </me>
        What are the prime factors of this number <m>m</m>? I know
        that all numbers break down uniquely into prime factors, so it
        must have prime factors. However, every prime number
        <m>p_i</m> in my list (which, by assumption, is all prime
        numbers) is a factor of <m>m-1</m>. A prime number can't be
        the factor of two consecutive numbers, so none of the prime
        numbers are factors of <m>m</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 3: State the contradiction. The number <m>m</m> must have
        prime factors, but cannot have prime factors, since none of
        the primes <m>p_i</m> are factors. This is a contradiction: the
        number must have prime factors but has none.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 4: Conclude that the original statement was false, which
        finishes the proof. The assumption that there were only
        finitely many prime numbers led to a contradiction. Therefore,
        by contradiction, I have proved that there are infinitely
        many prime numbers. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This proof is <em>non-constructive</em>. It tells me that there
      are infinitely many prime numbers, but it doesn't tell me 
      anything about them: what they are, how to find them, how they
      are distributed on the number line, etc. This is often a major
      weakness of proofs by contradiction: they may not give 
      concrete information about the objects in the proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another classic example is the proof that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is
      irrational. I will also prove this by contradiction.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Step 1: Assume the statement is false. The statement says that
        <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational. If that is false, then
        <m>\sqrt{2}</m> must be rational. Therefore, my assumption is
        that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is rational. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 2: Work from the assumption to build a contradiction. If
        <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is rational, then there are integers <m>a</m>
        and <m>b</m> such that <m>\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}</m>. Since
        any fraction can be written in the simplest terms, I can assume
        that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have no common factors. Then I can
        do some arithmetic with this equation.
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \sqrt{2} \amp = \frac{a}{b}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            2 \amp = \frac{a^2}{b^2} 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            2b^2 \amp = a^2 
          </mrow>
        </md>
        <m>2</m> divides the left side of the equation, so it must
        divide the right side as well, meaning that <m>a^2</m> must be
        even. But the squares of odd numbers are odd, and the squares
        of even numbers are even. Therefore, <m>a</m> must be even. I
        can write <m>a = 2c</m> for some integer <m>c</m>. Then I'll
        replace <m>a</m> by <m>2c</m> in the equation and do a bit more
        arithmetic. 
        <md>
          <mrow>
            2b^2 \amp = a^2 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            2b^2 \amp = (2c)^2 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            2b^2 \amp = 4c^2 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            b^2 \amp = 2c^2 
          </mrow>
        </md>
        Now <m>2</m> divides the right side of the equation, so it
        must divide the left as well. That means that <m>b^2</m> is
        even, so <m>b</m> must be even.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 3: State the contradiction. I assumed that <m>a</m>
        and <m>b</m> have no common factors since I wrote the
        fraction in the simplest terms. Now I have proved that both
        numbers are even, so <m>2</m> is a factor of both. This is a
        contradiction: <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have no common factors,
        but <m>2</m> is a common factor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 4: Conclude that the original statement was false, which
        finishes the proof. The assumption that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> was
        rational produced to a contradiction, so I have proved that
        <m>\sqrt{2}</m> must be irrational. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Proof by contradiction, as I mentioned at the start, relies on
      the assumption that any (well-formed) statement in mathematics
      is either true or false. That seems like a reasonable assumption
      in a logical system, and proof by contradiction is an important
      tool in mainstream mathematics. However, some versions of
      mathematics have rejected this assumption. There are some
      versions of mathematics that do not allow proof by
      contradiction. (These are called intuitionistic or
      constructionist mathematics). 
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml-id="subsection-induction">
    <title>Proof by Induction</title>
      <p>
        Proof by induction is a method of proving statements that are
        true for all natural numbers. When there isn't a direct
        argument, statements such as these can be difficult to prove,
        since there are infinitely many natural numbers to check.
        Mathematicians agree that the following process suffices to
        check all infinitely many cases.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Prove a base case. Usually, I prove that the statement
          holds for <m>n=0</m> or <m>n=1</m>, but the base case could
          be any starting natural number. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Assume that the statement is true for some number
          <m>k</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using this assumption, prove that the statement holds for
          the next number <m>k+1</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Conclude that the statement is true for all natural numbers
          <m>n</m>. (Or all numbers past the base case, if I started
          at a larger number.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This process is called mathematical induction. (This is really
        a terrible name. The reasoning here is still deductive
        reasoning, not inductive reasoning. Calling it induction
        really messes with the conventional use of the term
        <qt>induction</qt> in logic). Mathematical induction  is
        something like bootstrapping all the way up the natural
        numbers. I prove the statement is true for <m>1</m>. Then I
        have a general way of proving that if it is true for a number,
        it is also true for the next number. Since it is true for
        <m>1</m>, it must be true for <m>2</m>. If it is true for
        <m>2</m>, it must be true for <m>3</m>. If it is true for
        <m>3</m>, it must be true for <m>4</m>. This just keeps going,
        so I conclude that it is true for all natural numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, this is probably best demonstrated by example. I claim
        that for any natural number <m>n \geq 1</m>, 
        <me>
          1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
        </me>.
        This is a nice identity giving me a way to quickly calculate
        the sum of the first <m>n</m> numbers. For example
        <me>
          1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + 703 = \frac{703\cdot704}{2} = 703
          \cdot 352 = 247,456
        </me>.
        By doing one division and one multiplication, I know the sum
        of the first <m>703</m> numbers. This is certainly much faster
        than doing <m>702</m> additions. Now let's use mathematical
        induction to prove this statement. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Step 1: Prove the base case. The base case here is
          <m>n=1</m>. The left side is just <m>1</m>. The right side
          is <m>\frac{(1)(2)}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1</m>. Since the left
          side and the right side are the same, the base case holds. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 2: Assume the statement is true for some number
          <m>k</m>. I assume that 
          <me>
            1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
          </me>
          is true for some number <m>k</m>. (Not every number, yet,
          just some number.) 
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 3: Prove the next case. I need to prove the statement
          is true for <m>k+1</m>. I can start with the assumption.
          <me>
            1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
          </me>
          I can add <m>(k+1)</m> to both sides. 
          <me>
            1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + k + (k + 1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} +
            (k+1) 
          </me>
          Then I can do some arithmetic with the right side, starting
          with a common denominator. 
          <me>
            \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) = \frac{k^2 + k + 2(k + 1)}{2} =
            \frac{k^2 + 3k + 2}{2} = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}
          </me>
          Now I'll replace the right side with this last expression.
          <me>
            1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + k + (k + 1) = \frac{(k+1)(k+1+1)}{2}
          </me>
          Finally, I can observe that this right side is precisely the
          desired equation for <m>k+1</m>. I have proved the next
          case. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Since I have a base case, and I know that each base implies
          the following case, I conclude (by mathematical induction)
          that the statement holds for all natural numbers. 
        </li>
      </ul>
