          There isn't really a simpler way to write this number. This
          form is just fine. If I wanted an approximate value, I
          could ask a computer (WA): <m>\sqrt{14} +
          4 \pi^2 \doteq 217.78</m>. (When you write approximate
          values, please use this equals with a dot to indicate that
          this is approximately equal to, not exactly equal to.)

          Then I can ask a computer (WA) to give me the inverse
          cosine to get an approximation for the angle. (All angles
          are given in radians. The inverse cosine function will give
          an angle between 0 and <m>\pi</m>, which is good since the
          angle between two vector should be bounded by <m>\pi</m>
          radians.)

    <title>Sets with Structure</title>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In <xref ref="section-sets-with-structure" />, I
          introduced the abstract idea of sets with structure. In the
          next two activities, I'm asking you to think through that
          abstract idea. In the first activity, I've given you an
          empty table with some number sets and some possible
          structures.  Complete this table by writing <q>Yes</q> or
          <q>No</q> in each space. Write <q>Yes</q> if the set in
          question includes the structure (the structure must remain in
          the set); write <q>No</q> if the set does not include the
          structure. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The set <m>\ZZ/12\ZZ</m> is the integers modulo 12. If this
          set is unfamiliar, you may treat it as the numbers on the
          clock. So, for example, if I want to add <m>7 + 9</m>, I
          ask what time is 9 hours after 7, which is 4. Therefore <m>7
          + 9 = 4</m> in an example of proper arithmetic for this
          set. In general, whenever I would get a number larger than
          <m>11</m>, I subtract multiples of <m>12</m> to reduce it
          down to something between <m>0</m> and <m>11</m>.  For
          another example, <m>5 \times 4 = 8</m> is also proper
          arithmetic for this set, since <m>20 - 12 = 8</m>. Note that
          <m>12</m> is the same thing as <m>0</m> in this set; even
          though on a clock, I would often write <m>12</m>, in this
          set, I usually just write <m>0</m>. So, for example, I
          would write <m>5 + 7 = 0</m> in this set. Finally, this is
          just integers modulo 12, so I only consider the whole
          numbers of the clock <mdash /> I don't have minutes or any
          other subdivisions, only hours.

          Hopefully, most of these answers are straightforward. I'll
          comment on a few, though, which might be less obvious. 
          <ul>
            <li>
              The natural numbers can still be said to have absolute
              value, but the structure doesn't do anything. The
              absolute value of a positive number is itself, so the
              structure is very boring: all numbers are unchanged.
              This is why I wrote <q>trivially</q>, to indicate that
              the structure doesn't do anything.
            </li>
            <li>
              Division for the integers modulo 12 is tricky. I might
              think that since I can extend addition, subtraction and
              multiplication just fine for modulo 12, I could extend
              division as well. The problem is zero divisors: if I
              allow division by zero divisors, the arithmetic breaks.
              This is not immediatly obvious, so I didn't really expect
              anyone to know this unless you've previously studied
              modular arithmetic.
            </li>
            <li>
              Speaking of zero divisors, take the numbers 3 and 4 in
              the integers modulo 12. Their product is 12, which is
              the same as 0 in that system. So, I can reasonably say
              that <m>3 \times 4 = 0</m> in the integers modulo 12.
              Since 3 and 4 are not also equivalent to zero
              themselves, they are zero divisors. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Whether or not there is an order relation on the integers
              modulo 12 is also tricky. I can impose an order, saying
              that <m>0 \lt 1 \lt 2 \lt 3 \lt \ldots \lt 11</m>.
              However, since the numbers loop around, if I keep going
              from 12 back to 1, this seems intuitively problematic
              with this order. So, even though I could impose such an
              order, I think it makes more sense not to. I conclude that
              the integer modulo 12 is not ordered. If I think about
              time on a clock, I think I can justify this decision.
              If it is currently 10 o'clock, then there is a time
              before that was 5 o'clock as well as a time in the
              future, which will also be 5 o'clock. Therefore, putting
              an order seems unreasonable.

          The structures I've included so far have mostly been binary
          operations (the conventional four of arithmetic) and some
          other familiar things like order and absolute value.
          However, structures can be as complicated as I like. Here
          are some more involved structures. For each structure, give
          an example of a number set that has the structure. (Some of
          these are a bit tricky: you are allowed to restrict the
          conventional number sets to make this work. For example, the
          set of all positive rational numbers is a number set,
          as is the set of all natural numbers less than 40.)

      <solution>
        <p>
          There are a variety of possible answers, but here are my
          suggestions for some reasonable responses.
        </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Decomposition of numbers into prime factors (except for
              0 and 1): This is true of <m>\NN</m>. Positive whole
              numbers (larger than 1) do decompose into prime factors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reciprocals of non-zero numbers: <m>\QQ</m> or
              <m>\RR</m> would work here, since those number sets have
              division and reciprocals are just a specific instance of
              division. 
            </li>
            <li>
              The ability to do long division with a remainder: this
              works in <m>\NN</m>. Note that the remainder is important
              here: division is not exact in <m>\NN</m>, since we
              don't have fractions. However, I can say that 7 goes
              into 40 five times, with a remainder of 5 <mdash /> that
              still just uses whole numbers. 
            </li>
            <li>
              You can get the whole set just by starting with 1 and
              allowing yourself to do any number of additions: this is
              true for <m>\NN</m>. Any positive number can be thought
              of as adding 1 some number of times. For example: <m>8 =
              1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1</m>. In this way, the
              number 1 and the addition operation generate all of the
              natural numbers. 
            </li>
            <li>
              All numbers have square roots. This is a bit tricky,
              since none of the conventional number sets have this
              property. I have to make a restriction. I certainly
              want to work with real numbers, since I know that
              <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is already irrational. I'm not going to
              find square roots in the natural numbers, the integers,
              or the rational numbers. But the negative numbers cause
              a problem: they do not have square roots in the real
              numbers. I can exclude these by taking the set of all
              positive real numbers. This set has the structure of all
              numbers having square roots. 
            </li>
            <li>
              The existence of a maximal element (some number in the
              set which is larger than all other numbers). Again, no
              standard number set will have this structure, since they
              are all unbounded and keep getting larger forever.
              However, I can make a restriction and take a bounded
              subset. Consider, for example, all natural numbers less
              than 40 (as I suggested in the statement of the
              problem). This set has a maximal element of 39, since
              everything else in the set is a whole number less than
              or equal to 39.

      <statement>
        <p>
          This is a guided proof to prove the triangle inequality
          using the dot product. The triangle inequality states that
          for any vector <m>u,v \in \RR^n</m>, the length of the sum
          is bounded by the sum of the lengths of the individual
          vectors. In symbols:
          <me>
            |u+v| \leq |u| + |v|
          </me>.
          I'm going to give you several small steps which fit together
          into a complete proof. I want you to write out the details
          of each step and make it fit together into a whole argument. 
          <ol>
            <li>
              Write <m>|u+v|^2</m> as a dot product.
            </li>
            <li>
              Expand that dot product (distribute the pieces).
            </li>
            <li>
              Replace <m>u \cdot v</m> with <m>|u||v| \cos \theta</m>. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Use the fact that <m>\cos \theta \leq 1</m> to make the
              equality into an inequality.
            </li>
            <li>
              Manipulate the inequality to show that <m>|u+v|^2 \leq
              (|u| + |v|)^2</m>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take the square root of both sides (which preserves the
              inequality and is well defined since both sides are
              positive). 
            </li>
            <li>
              Conclude the triangle inequality. 
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          I'll follow the guided steps for this proof. First, I'll
          write <m>|u+v|^2</m> as a dot product. I use the fact that
          the square of the length of a vector is the same as the dot
          product of a vector with itself. 
          <me>
            |u+v|^2 = (u+v) \cdot (u+v)
          </me>
          The next step is to distribute the right side. The dot
          product distributes over vector addition like ordinary
          multipliction. Since the dot product is commutative, <m>u
          \cdot v</m> is the same as <m>v \cdot u</m>, so I can
          combine the two term when I distribute the dot product. 
          <me>
            |u+v|^2 = u \cdot u + 2 u \cdot v + v \cdot v 
          </me>
          The middle term has the dot product which I can replace as
          instructed in the third step. 
          <me>
            |u+v|^2 = u \cdot u + 2 |u||v| \cos \theta + v \cdot v 
          </me>
          The cosine term is at most <m>1</m>, so the maximum for the
          right side happens when I replace the cosine with 1. 
          <me>
            |u+v|^2 \leq u \cdot u + 2 |u||v| + v \cdot v 
          </me>
          Then I need to turn the right side into a square term. The
          first step in that direction is to write the dot products
          as squares of lengths. 
          <me>
            |u+v|^2 \leq |u|^2 + 2 |u||v| + |v|^2
          </me>
          Then the right side is the square of a binomial.
          <me>
            |u+v|^2 \leq \left( |u| + |v| \right)^2 
          </me>
          Finally, I take the square root of both sides. The square
          root of positive numbers preserves inequalities (<m>a \leq
          b</m> if an only if <m>\sqrt{a}\leq \sqrt{b}</m>), so
          applying the square root is a valid operations for sovling
          an inequality like this.
          <me>
            |u+v| \leq |u| + |v| 
          </me>
          I have produced the triangle inequality.

          I will start with the right side and try to manipulate it
          into the left side. I'll write the vectors in their
          components, use the definition of the cross product, and
          bring in the <m>(-1)</m> using the definition of scalar
          multiplication.

                u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3

              \amp = - \left( \left( \begin{matrix}

                - v_3 u_1 + v_1 u_3 \\
                - v_1 u_2 + v_2 u_1 
              \end{matrix} \right) \right)
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Now I just write each component in the other order,
          interchaging the order of each multiplication, and
          recognize the definition of the cross product in the result.

            = \left( \left( \begin{matrix}
              u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2 \\
              u_3 v_1 - u_1 v_3 \\
              u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1 
            \end{matrix} \right) \right) = u \times v

          I started with the right side and made a chain of equality
          to the left side, thus proving the identity.

          What is a normal vector to a plane or hyperplane? Why are
          planes and hyperplanes determined by normals?
        </li>
        <li>
          Why do cross products help calculate normals to planes in
          three dimensions?
