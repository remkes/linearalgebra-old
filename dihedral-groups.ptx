    <title>Dihedral Groups</title>
    <p>
      The case of regular polygons, such as the hexagon, is a very
      useful place to talk about symmetry.  I want to know which
      linear transformations preserve the regular polygons. By
      <sq>preserve</sq>, in this section I mean that the new shape is
      precisely the same as the old: same size and same positions.
      Some of the vertices and edges may have been moved, but the
      result ends up tracing over exaclty the same original shape. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>Dihedral Group</term> is the group of linear
          symmetries of a regular polygon. If the polygon has
          <m>n</m> edges, then I write <m>D_n</m> for the associated
          dihedral group. Thus, <m>D_3</m> is the group of symmetries
          of the triangle, <m>D_4</m> is the group of symmetries of
          the square, <m>D_5</m> is the group of symmetries of the
          pentagon, and so on. (Some texts use <m>D_{2n}</m> instead
          of <m>D_n</m>.)
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      You may have noticed that I used the word <sq>group</sq>
      instead of <sq>set</sq> to describe this collection.
      <sq>Group</sq> is a technical word in mathematics, referring to a
      set with some extra properties. Let me give the definition in
      somewhat formal language. (In this definition, a binary
      operation is that takes two elements and combines them into one.
      It is a general term that includes addition or numbers,
      multiplication or number, or composition of transformations: in
      each operation, two things are combined together). 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
      Let <m>G</m> be a set with an (associative) binary operation
      represented by writing two elements next to each other (as is
      common with multiplication of variables). <m>G</m> is a group
      if it satisfies these properties.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          There is an element <m>e</m>, called the identity element.
          If <m>g</m> is any other element of the group, then <m>ge =
          eg = g</m>. (Multiplication by the identity doesn't do
          anything to any group element). 
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          For each element of the group <m>g</m>, there is a
          unique element <m>g^{-1}</m> such that <m>gg^{-1} = g^{-1}g =
          e</m>. (Everything in a group has an inverse). 
        </p></li>
      </ul>
    </definition>
    <p>
      You already know a number of groups. 
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          <m>\ZZ</m> is a group under the operation of addition.
          <m>0</m> is the identity element, and the inverse of any
          <m>a</m> is <m>-a</m>. 
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          <m>\QQ \setminus \{0\}</m> is a group under multiplication.
          <m>1</m> is the identity, and the inverse of any fraction
          <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> is <m>\frac{b}{a}</m>. Obviously, I
          needed to exclude <m>0</m> since I cannot divide by
          <m>0</m>, and therefore it wouldn't have an inverse in the
          group. 
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          <m>\RR \setminus \{0\}</m> is also a group under
          multiplication.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          In <xref ref="section-inversion" />, I defined the general
          linear group <m>GL_n(\RR)</m>. This was all <m>n \times
          n</m> invertible matrices. The identity matrix (of size
          <m>n</m>) is the identity element; the composition is the
          <sq>multiplication,</sq> and the matrix inverse is the
          inverse operation. By restriction to only invertible
          matrices of a fixed size, all elements can be composed
          together, and all elements have inverses. 
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          In <xref ref="section-inversion" />, I defined three more
          matrix groups: the special linear group <m>SL_n(\RR)</m>,
          the orthogonal group <m>O_n(\RR)</m> and the special
          orthogonal group <m>SO_n(\RR)</m>. These are smaller sets of
          invertible matrices with particular properties. Each of
          them contains the identity matrix and has inverses, which are
          matrices with the same restricted properties.
        </p></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this course, I will primarily discuss dihedral groups to
      understand what groups are all about. In other institutions with
      larger mathematics programs, courses are devoted exclusively to
      Group Theory, which is an active and important area of
      mathematical research.

    <p>
      First consider the symmetries of the square to more
      clearly understand this construction.
      I assume the origin is at the centre of
      the square, and I can put the vertices of the square at
      <m>(1,1)</m>, <m>(1,-1)</m>, <m>(-1,-1)</m> and
      <m>(-1,1)</m>. Conveniently, the vertices are all I need
      to think about: since linear transformations preserve lines,
      if I know where the vertices go, then I know that the
      lines connecting them are preserved, and hence the shape is
      preserved. Which transformations preserve the vertices?
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two relatively obvious classes that might occur.
      First, there is rotation about the origin. If I
      rotate by <m>\pi/2</m> radians (a quarter turn), the
      vertices are preserved. Likewise for rotations by
      <m>\pi</m> and <m>3\pi/2</m> radians. If I am really
      paying attention, I might also think of rotation by
      <m>2\pi</m> radians, a full turn. This might seem silly,
      but the identity transformation (the transformation that
      leaves everything fixed) is a very important transformation
      and should be included in the list. So, for now, the symmetries
      of the square include the identity and three rotations. I'll
      call these three rotations <m>R_1</m>, <m>R_2</m> and
      <m>R_3</m>, in the order I defined them. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I might also think about reflections. Looking at the
      square, I can find four lines of reflection: the
      <m>x</m>-axis, the <m>y</m>-axis, the line <m>x=y</m> and the
      line <m>x=-y</m>. I'd like to label the reflection by taking
      the lines of reflection in counter-clockwise order starting
      from the <m>x</m>-axis: the reflection over the <m>x</m>-axis
      is <m>F_1</m>; the reflection over <m>y=x</m> is <m>F_2</m>;
      the reflection over the <m>y</m>-axis is <m>F_3</m>; and the
      reflection over <m>y=-x</m> is <m>F_4</m>. The lines in <xref
      ref="figure-d4" /> are labelled with these reflection names. 
    </p>
    <p>
      That brings the total number of transformations to eight: the
      identity, three rotations, and four reflections. These eight
      are, in fact, the complete group.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I've constructed a group of symmetries of the square. I
      have eight elements, one of which is the identity and the
      operation of composition. The abstract question that
      mathematicians ask now is: what is the structure of this
      group? By <sq>structure,</sq> I mean the elements but, more
      importantly, how the elements relate to each other when
      composed. To show this structure, I can build a
      multiplication table for the group. Such a table would
      explicitly show all the compositions. It is structured very much
      like the multiplication tables for numbers that you learned in
      elementary school <emdash/>; you are now just studying a new kind
      of multiplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make the multiplication table, I need to know how to easily
      calculate the composition of elements. I could do this by
      writing their matrices and doing the matrix multiplication. That
      would work, but I want to show you an easier method <emdash/> one
      much more connected to the geometry of the square. I'm going to
      represent each element of the group simply by how it permutes
      the vertices. In <xref ref="figure-d4" />, I labelled the
      vertices. By showing where each vertex goes, I can describe each
      transformation. For example, the rotation <m>R_1</m> sends each
      vertex to the next vertex counterclockwise. I can represent this
      by the following vertex movements.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          1 \mapsto 2 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          2 \mapsto 3 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          3 \mapsto 4 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          4 \mapsto 1 
        </mrow>
      </md>
      The reflection <m>F_2</m> is over the line <m>y=x</m>. It fixes
      the two vertices which lie on that line and switches the other
      two. I can represent this by the following vertex movements. 
      <md>
        <mrow>
          1 \mapsto 1
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          2 \mapsto 4
        </mrow>
        <mrow>  
          3 \mapsto 3
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          4 \mapsto 2
        </mrow>
      </md>
      Now I can use these vertex movements to understand composition.
      Consider <m>R_1 \circ F_2</m>. Since composition works from right
      to left, this is doing the reflection first, then the rotation.
      I can put the two sets of vertex movements together.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          1 \mapsto 1 \mapsto 2 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          2 \mapsto 4 \mapsto 1
        </mrow>
        <mrow>  
          3 \mapsto 3 \mapsto 4
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          4 \mapsto 2 \mapsto 3 
        </mrow>
      </md>
      Then I can ask: what is this transformation? This switches
      vertices <m>1</m> and <m>2</m>, and also switches the other two
      vertices. This must be reflected over the <m>y</m>-axis, which
      is <m>F_3</m>. Therefore, <m>R_1 \circ F_2 = F_3</m>. I've
      calculated a multiplication. What happens if I reverse the
      order: <m>F_2 \circ R_1</m>? Now the rotation happens first, but
      I can still calculate the vertex movements by doing the rotation
      then the reflection.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          1 \mapsto 2 \mapsto 4
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          2 \mapsto 3 \mapsto 3
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          3 \mapsto 4 \mapsto 2
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          4 \mapsto 1 \mapsto 1
        </mrow>
      </md>
      This transformation switches vertices <m>1</m> and <m>4</m>, and
      also switches vertices <m>2</m> and <m>3</m>. It must be the
      reflection over the <m>x</m>-axis, which is called <m>F_1</m>.
      Therefore, <m>F_2 \circ R_1 = F_1</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, I can calculate all the compositions and put them
      into a multiplication table. In this table, each entry is the
      composition of the row and then the column; therefore, the column
      entry happens first (again, right to left) and the row entry
      second.

    <p>
      From the table, I can see a number of patterns, all of which
      are part of the structure of this group. Even with eight
      elements, there is already a fair bit to talk about. The
      composition of any two rotations is another rotation. Moreover,
      rotations commute with each other (they can be composed in
      either order without changing the result). The composition of any
      two reflections is also a rotation. The composition of any
      rotation and any reflection is some other reflection. The
      rotations and reflections do not commute, nor do reflections
      commute with each other. In each row and each column, each group
      element shows up exactly once.
