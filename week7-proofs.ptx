    <title>Interactions between Definitions</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="section-kernels-and-images" />, I defined a number
      of terms: rowspace, columnspace, kernel, image and preimage.  In
      this section, I want to prove some properties of these new
      definitions. All these terms, along with the matrix rank, fit
      togther very tightly.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>M</m> be an <m>m \times n</m> matrix, representing a
          transformation <m>\RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m>. The dimension
          of the kernel of <m>M</m> and the dimension of the image of
          <m>M</m> add up to <m>n</m>, the dimension of the domain.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          I know the dimension of the image is the rank, which is the
          number of leading ones in the reduced row echelon form. I
          also know that the dimension of the kernel is the dimension
          of the system of equations represented by the extended
          matrix <m>(M|0)</m>. The dimension of a solution space to a
          system of equations is equal to the number of free
          parameters. Each column without a leading one in the
          extended matrix (left of the dividing line) is a free
          variable. Therefore, the dimension of the kernel is the
          number of columns without leading ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each column in the row reduced form of <m>M</m> either has
          or does not have a leading one. The columns with leading
          ones contribute to the rank. The columns without leading
          ones are free parameters for the system. Therefore, the
          dimensions of the image (rank) plus the dimension of the
          kernel (free parameters) add up to the number of columns,
          which is <m>n</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>M</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix. <m>M</m> is
          invertible if and only if its kernel is zero. 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          For this <qt>if and only if</qt> statement, I need to prove
          in both directions. I'll start with the forward
          implication. For this direction of the proof, I must assume
          the matrix is invertible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the matrix is invertible, it row reduces to the
          identity matrix. (I know this from the inversion algorithm,
          where I must row reduce the left side of the extended
          matrix to the identity.) That means it has rank <m>n</m>,
          since each row has a leading one. This means that the image
          has dimension <m>n</m> since the dimension of the image is
          equal to the rank. Using the previous proposition, this fact 
          implies that the kernel has dimension <m>0</m>. The only thing
          with dimension zero is a point, so the kernel is a point.
          The kernel always includes zero, since zero is also always
          sent to zero, so the kernel must just be the zero vector.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have to prove the reverse implication as well. Luckily in
          this case, I can essentially reverse the same logic. A zero
          kernel has dimension zero. Therefore the image has to have
          dimension <m>n</m>. Therefore, there must be <m>n</m> leading
          ones. Therefore, the matrix must reduce to the identity
          matrix (the only <m>n \times n</m> matrix with <m>n</m>
          leading ones). Thus, the matrix is invertible.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      It turns out that there will be many ways to describe an
      invertible matrix. I'll start a list of equivalent properties of
      invertible matrices, which will be extended throughout the
      course. Assume <m>M</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix. The
      following properties are equivalent (each implies all the rest).
      <ul>
        <li>
          <m>M</m> is invertible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>M</m> row reduces to the identity matrix.
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>M</m> has rank <m>n</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The image of <m>M</m> is <m>\RR^n</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The kernel of <m>M</m> is zero.
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>M</m> preserves the dimension of any (linear or affine)
          object it acts upon
        </li>
      </ul>
