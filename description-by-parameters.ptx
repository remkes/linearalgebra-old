    <title>Solution Spaces and Free Parameters</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If I have a system of equations in the variables <m>x_1,
          x_2, \ldots, x_n</m>, the set of values for these variables
          which satisfy all the equations is called the
          <term>solution space</term> of the system. Since each set
          of values is a vector, I think of the solution space as a
          subset of <m>\RR^n</m>. For linear equations, the solution
          space will always be an affine subspace. If I have encoded
          the system of equations in an extended matrix, we can refer
          to the solution space of the matrix instead of the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The term <sq>solution space</sq> is a conventional term in
          algebra, since it refers to the solution of some equations.
          However, geometrically, I haven't actually done anything
          knew. The set of points that satisfy some number of equation
          is the locus of those equations. So solutions spaces are
          just another name for loci. The description of solutions
          spaces in this section can also be understood as
          descriptions of loci.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Since solution spaces are affine, they can be written as
          <m>u + L</m> where <m>u</m> is a fixed offset vector, and
          <m>L</m> is a linear space. Since <m>L</m> is linear, it
          has a basis <m>v_1, v_2, \ldots v_k</m>, and any vector in
          <m>L</m> is a linear combination of the <m>v_i</m>. I can
          write any and all solutions to the system in the following
          fashion (where <m>a_i \in \RR</m>).
          <me>
            u + a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + a_3v_3 + \ldots + a_kv_k
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          In such a description of the solution space, I call the
          <m>a_i</m> <term>free parameters</term>. One of the goals
          in solving systems is to determine the number of free
          parameters for each solution space.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      I want to show how to go from reduced row echelon matrices to
      descriptions of solutions spaces by parameters. This is best to
      do with a series of examples showing all the various
      posibilities. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let me start with a matrix that encodes a unique solution. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -3 \\
            0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 8
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
          This example is the easiest case: there is a leading one in
          each row and column left of the horizontal line, and I just
          read off the solution, <m>x=-3</m>, <m>y=-2</m> and
          <m>z=8</m>. There are no parameters, since the solution is
          unique. The <sq>description by parameters</sq> is just the
          statement of the unique solution.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          I might have a row of zeros in the reduced row-echelon
          form.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -3 \\
            0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 8 \\
            0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \end{array} \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This row of zeros doesn't actually change the solution at
          all: it is still <m>x=-3</m>, <m>y=-2</m> and <m>z=8</m>.
          The last line just corresponds to an equation that says
          <m>0x + 0y + 0z = 0</m> or just <m>0=0</m>, which is always
          true. Rows of zeros arise from redundant equations in the
          original system. This still have a unique solution and no
          free parameters.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          There might be a column of zeros. Consider something similar
          to the previous examples, but now in four variables
          <m>w,x,y,z</m>. (In that order, so that the first column is
          the <m>w</m> column, the second is the <m>x</m> column, and
          so on).
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{cccc|c} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0
            \amp -3 \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\ 0 \amp
            0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 8 \end{array} \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The translation gives <m>w=-3</m>, <m>x=-2</m> and
          <m>y=8</m>, but the matrix says nothing about <m>z</m>. A
          column of zeros corresponds to a free variable: any value of
          <m>z</m> solves the system as long as the other variables
          are set. This system has one free paramter. A description of
          the solution by parameters here would show that the first
          three coefficients are constant, but <m>z</m> can be
          anything. I can express this as a sum of vectors. 
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix} w \\ x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} =
            \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 8 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + z
            \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The columns of free variables need not contain all zeros.
          The following matrix is still in reduced row-echelon form.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{cccc|c} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 2
            \amp -3 \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp -1 \amp -2 \\ 0 \amp
            0 \amp 1 \amp -1 \amp 8 \end{array} \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Reduced row-echelon form needs a leading one in each
          non-zero row, and all other entries in a column with a lead
          one must be zero. This matrix satisfies all the conditions.
          The fourth column corresponds to the <m>z</m> variable but
          lacks a leading one. Any column lacking a leading one
          corresponds to a free variable. Look at the translation of
          this matrix back into a linear system.

          I have included the last equation, which is trivial to
          satisfy, to show how all the terms depend on <m>z</m>. This
          makes it clear that <m>z</m> is a free parameter. I can
          write the solution as follows in terms of that free
          parameter.
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix} w \\ x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} =
            \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 8 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + z
            \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Any choice of <m>z</m> will solve this system. If I want
          a specific solution, I take specific values of <m>z</m>.
          For example, if <m>z=1</m>, these equations give <m>w=-5,
          x=-1</m> and <m>y=9</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, this description by parameters describes the
          solutions as an offset span. The columns of
          constants is the offset and the free variable gives the
          span, in this case, just the span of one vector.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="example-description-by-parameters">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The following matrix is also in reduced row-echelon form
          (again, using <m>w</m>, <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> as
          variables in that order).
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{cccc|c} 1 \amp 0 \amp 3 \amp 2
            \amp -3 \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp -1 \amp -1 \amp -2

          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, both the third and the fourth columns have no leading
          one; therefore, both <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> are free
          variables. I translate the matrix back into a linear
          system.
          <md>

          Then I can write the solution using the free parameters. 
          I can express the four equations as one equation of vectors;
          each equation is the equation of one of the four components
          of the vectors, filling in zeros for anything not mentioned
          in the equations.

        <p>
          Any choice of <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> gives a solution. For
          example, if <m>y=0</m> and <m>z=1</m> then <m>w=-5</m> and
          <m>x=-1</m> complete a solution.

          I can also have a reduced row-echelon matrix of
          the following form. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -3 \\
            0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 8 \\
            0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \end{array} \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The first three rows translate into equations without issue.
          However, the fourth row translates to <m>0x+0y+0z = 1</m> or
          <m>0=1</m>.  Obviously, this can never be satisfied. Any row
          which translates to <m>0=1</m> leads to a contradiction.
          A contradition means that the system has no solutions, since
          the <m>0=1</m> can never be satisfied. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      I will  summarize the three possible situations for reduced
      row-echelon matrices.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If there is a row that translates to <m>0=1</m>, then
            there is a contradiction, and the system has no solutions.
            This overrides any other information: whether or not there
            are free variables elsewhere, there are still no
            solutions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If there are no <m>0=1</m> rows and all columns left of
            the vertical line have leading ones; then there is a
            unique solution. There are no columns representing free
            variables, and each variable has a specific value that can
            be ead directly from the matrix.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If there are no <m>0=1</m> rows and there is at least one
            column left of the vertical line without a leading one;
            then each such column represents a free variable. The
            remaining variables can be expressed in terms of the free
            variables, and any choices of the free variables lead to a
            solution. There are infinitely many solutions. The
            solutions space can always be expressed as an offset span.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, note that there are only three basic cases for
      the number of solutions: none, one, or infinitely many. No
      linear system has exactly two or exactly three solutions. In
      the case of infinitely many solutions, the interesting question
      is the dimension of the solution space. This question, however,
      is easily answered.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The dimension of a solution space of a linear system of
          equations is the number of free variables. Equivalently, the
          dimension of a locus is the number of free varialbes in its
          solution when expressed as a system of equations.
