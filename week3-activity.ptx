          I need to write the first vector as a multiple of the
          second plus a multiple of the third.

          I have to solve this system. If I isolate <m>a</m> in the
          first equation, I get <m>a = 2-b</m>. If I replace that in
          the second equation, I get <m>3 = -2 + b + b</m>. I can
          solve this to get <m>b = \frac{5}{2}</m>. Then the
          expression for <m>a</m> gives <m>a = 2 - b = 2 - \frac{5}{2}
          = \frac{-1}{2}</m>. That lets me write the linear
          combination.

          I could try to solve this by linear system as I did
          before, but I'll try to work by inspection first, so I can see if
          I can informally find a solution. Since the second vector
          is the only vector of the last three that has an <m>x</m>
          component, I know that <m>a = 3</m> is the only way to get
          a 3 in the first coordinate. That gives me one constant.
          Then, looking at the <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> coordinates, we
          can see that if I simply add the third and fourth vectors
          togother, the <m>y</m> cancels and the <m>z</m> adds to 2.
          Therefore, I can conclude that <m>b = c = 1</m>

          The second vector is clearly independent of the other two
          since it only has a <m>z</m> coordinate and the others have
          0 in the <m>z</m> coordinate. It points in the <m>z</m>
          direction, while the others are restricted to the <m>x-y</m>
          plane. For the first and third vector, the dot product shows
          that they are perpendicular, so they point in fundamentally
          different directions. I conclude that this is a linearly

          have different directions in the <m>yz</m> plane, so this
          span does span all of the <m>yz</m> plane. Therefore, since none
          of the vectors is a multiple of the others, any two vectors
          form a basis. I can also take the subset of the standard
          basis that spans the <m>yz</m> plane: <m>\{e_2, e_3\}</m>.

          All of the vector point in axis directions in <m>\RR^5</m>,
          and all the axis directions are different. I conclude that
          this is a linearly independent set, so I can take all four
          vectors as a basis. Since I get the first, second, third
          and fifth axis directions, I could also take a portion of
          the standard basis that spans those four directions:

          are all multiples of the standard basis vector <m>e_2</m>.
          Therefore, the span is one-dimensional and any individual

      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider a set of three vectors in <m>\RR^3</m> such that
          all three vectors have a 0 <m>x</m> coordinate. Prove that
          these three vectors cannot be linearly independent.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          There are a number of possible approaches here. First, I
          can talk about fundamentally different directions. If all
          three vectors have a 0 <m>x</m> component, then they are all
          found in the <m>yz</m>. In that plane (like any plane),
          there are only two fundamentally different directions.
          Therefore, a set of three vectors cannot have fundamentally
          different directions, hence cannot be linearly independent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, I could delete the first coordinate of each
          vector and think of the resulting vectors in <m>\RR^2</m>.
          Then I would have three vectors in <m>\RR^2</m>, so they are
          linearly independent, and there exists a way to write one of
          the vectors as a linear combination of the others: <m>u  =
          av + bw</m>. Since all I did was deleted a zero component
          from each vector, this relationship will still work with
          the original vectors in <m>\RR^3</m>, proving that they are
          linearly independent.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that if a set of non-zero vectors are pairwise
          orthogonal (the dot product of any two vectors in the set is
          zero), then the set must be linearly independent.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Again, there are several possible approaches. First, I can
          think about fundamentally different directions. Since all
          the vectors in the set are perpendicular to all the other
          vectors, there is no way that they can share any kind of
          common direction. This means that they all need a
          fundamentally new, perpendicular-to-all-others direction.
          Therefore, they must be a basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          More formally, I could prove by contradiction. Assume that
          the vectors are linearly independent. Let the vectors be
          written <m>\{v_i\}</m> (each index indicates a different
          vector, not the components of one vector).  Linear
          dependence means I can find constant <m>a_i</m> such that
          not all of the <m>a_i</m> are zero and 
          <me>
            a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + \ldots + a_nv_n = 0
          </me>.
          Now take the dot product of this equation with the vector
          <m>v_i</m>.
          <me>
            v_i \cdot (a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + \ldots + a_nv_n) = v_i \cdot 0 
          </me>
          On the right, the dot product of any vector with the zero
          vector is zero. On the right, the dot product is linear, so
          I can distribute and pull out constants. 
          <me>
            a_1(v_i \cdot v_1) + a_2(v_i \cdot v_2) + \ldots + a_n(v_i
            \cdot v_n)) = v_i \cdot 0 
          </me>
          But all the vectors are perpendicular, so on the left,
          everything is zero except for <m>v_i \cdot v_i</m>.
          <me>
            a_i (v_i \cdot v_i) = 0 
          </me>
          Then I can write the dot product as a length squared. 
          <me>
            a_i |v_i| = 0 
          </me>
          Since the vector <m>v_i</m> is not zero, the constant
          <m>a_i</m> must be. But I did this arbitrarily for any
          index <m>i</m>, so this means all of the constant <m>a_i</m>
          must be zero. This contradicts the assumption that at least
          one of the constants is non-zero. This contradiction means
          that the original assumption must be wrong. I conclude that
          the vectors are linearly independent. 
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that any linear subspace has a basis of vector which
          all have length 1.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Any linear subspace has a basis of non-zero vectors. For any
          linear subspace, take any basis whatever. Then, for every
          vector <m>v</m> in that basis, replace <m>v</m> with
          <m>\frac{1}{|v|} v</m>. This new vector is a scalar multiple
          of the old, so it points in the same direction. Since the
          directions have not changed, these new replacement vectors
          are still a basis: they still all point in fundamentally
          different directions. But, by dividing by the original
          lengths, the lengths of these new vectors are all 1.
          Therefore, I have constructed a basis of vectors of length
          1. Since I made no assumption on the linear subspace, I
          conclude that all linear subspaces have a basis of vectors
          of length 1.
