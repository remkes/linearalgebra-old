    <title>Definitions</title>
    <p>
      After a good definition of the environment (<m>\RR^n</m>) and
      its objects (lines, planes, hyperplanes, etc.), the next
      mathematical step is to understand the functions that live in
      the environment and affect its objects. First, I need to
      generalize the simple notion of a function to linear spaces. 
      Algebra and calculus are concerned with functions of real numbers.
      These functions are rules <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m> which go
      between subsets of real numbers. The function <m>f</m> assigns
      to each <em>number</em> in <m>A</m> a unique <em>number</em> in
      <m>B</m>.  These functions include the very familiar <m>f(x) =
      x^2</m>, <m>f(x) = \sin (x)</m>, <m>f(x) = e^x</m> and many others.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be subsets of <m>\RR^n</m> and
          <m>\RR^m</m>, respectively. A <term>function</term> between
          linear spaces is a rule <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m>, which
          assigns to each <term>vector</term> in A a unique
          <term>vector</term> in <m>B</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example xml:id="example-function1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          I can define a function <m>f: \RR^3 \rightarrow \RR^3</m>
          by <m>f\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\z \end{pmatrix} =
          \begin{pmatrix}x^2\\y^2\\z^2 \end{pmatrix}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="example-function2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Another function <m>f: \RR^3 \rightarrow \RR^2</m> could be
          <m>f\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\z \end{pmatrix} =
          \begin{pmatrix}x-y\\z-y \end{pmatrix}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>linear function</term> or <term>linear
          transformation</term> from <m>\RR^n</m> to <m>\RR^m</m> is a
          function <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> such that for two
          vectors, <m>u,v \in \RR^n</m> and any scalar <m>a \in
          \RR</m>, the function must obey two rules.
          <md>
            <mrow>f(u+v) \amp  = f(u) + f(v)</mrow>
            <mrow>f(au) \amp  = af(u)</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Often I will say that the function <term>respects</term>
          the two main operations on linear spaces: addition of
          vectors and multiplication by scalars. If I perform
          addition before or after the function, I get the same
          result. Likewise for scalar multiplication.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      By inspection and testing, I could determine that <xref
      ref="example-function1" /> example above fails these two rules,
      but <xref ref="example-function2" /> satisfies them. Therefore,
      the later is a linear transformation but the former is not. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This definition creates a restrictive but important class
      of linear functions. I could easily define linear algebra as a
      study of these transformations. The defintiion gives so far is
      an algebraic definition; however, there is also an elegant
      geometric description of these functions.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> is linear if
          and only if it sends linear objects to linear objects.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      Under a linear transformation, points, lines, planes and etc.
      are changed to other points, lines, planes and etc. A line can't
      be bent into an arc or broken into two different lines.
      Hopefully, some of the major ideas of the course are starting to
      fit together: the two basic operations of addition and scalar
      multiplication give rise to spans, which are flat objects.
      Linear transformations preserve those operations, so they
      preserve flat objects.  Exactly <em>how</em> they change these
      objects can be tricky to determine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, because of scalar multiplication, if I take <m>a =
      0</m> we get that <m>f(0) = 0</m>. Under a linear
      transformation, the origin is always sent to the origin. So, in
      addition to preserving flat objects, linear transformations can't
      move the origin. I could drop this condition of preserving the
      origin to get another class of functions.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An <term>affine transformation</term> from <m>\RR^n</m> to
          <m>\RR^m</m> is a transformation that preserves affine
          subspaces. These transformations preserve flat objects but
          may move the origin.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Though they are interesting, I don't spend much time with
      affine transformations. They can always be realized as a linear
      transformation combined with a shift or displacement of the
      entire space by a fixed vector. Since shifts are relatively
      simple, I can usually reduce problems of affine transformations
      to problems of linear transformations.

    <title>Composition</title>
    <p>
      Composition is a very important idea for the study of
      real-valued functions in calculus. It likewise is very important
      for linear transformations.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f : \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> and <m>g: \RR^m
          \rightarrow \RR^l</m> be linear transformations. Then <m>g
          \circ f : \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^l</m> is the linear
          transformation formed by first applying <m>f</m> and then
          <m>g</m>. Note that the <m>\RR^m</m> has to match: <m>f</m>
          outputs to <m>\RR^m</m>, which is the input for <m>g</m>.
          Also note that the notation is written right-to-left: In
          <m>g \circ f</m>, the transformation <m>f</m> happens first,
          followed by <m>g</m>. This new transformation is called the
          <term>composition</term> of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-transformations-symmetry">
    <title>Symmetry</title>
    <p>
      Notice that I've defined linear functions by the objects and/or
      properties they preserve. This is a very general technique in
      mathematics. Very frequently, functions are classified by what
      they preserve. As discussed in the very first chapter, I use
      the word <sq>symmetry</sq> to describe this perspective: the
      symmetries of a function are the objects or algebraic properties
      preserved by the function. A function exhibits more symmetry if
      it preserves more objects or more properties. The conventional
      use of symmetry in English relates more to a shape than a
      function: what are the symmetries of a hexagon?  I can connect
      the two ideas: asking for the symmetries of the hexagon can be
      thought of as asking for the transformations of <m>\RR^2</m>
      that preserve a hexagon. This is a bit of a reverse: the
      standard usage of the word talks about transformation as the
      symmetries of a shape. Here we start with a transformation and
      talk about the shape as a symmetry of the transformation: the
      hexagon is a symmetry of rotation by one-sixth of a full turn.
