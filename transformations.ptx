    <p>
      After a good definition of the environment (<m>\RR^n</m>) and
      its objects (lines, planes, hyperplanes, etc.), the next
      mathematical step is to understand the functions that live in
      the environment and affect its objects. First, we need to
      generalize the simple notion of a function to linear spaces. In
      algebra and calculus, we worked with functions of real numbers.
      These functions are rules <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m> which go
      between subsets of real numbers  The function <m>f</m> assigns
      to each <em>number</em> in <m>A</m> a unique <em>number</em> in
      <m>B</m>  They include the very familiar <m>f(x) = x^2</m>,
      <m>f(x) = \sin (x)</m>, <m>f(x) = e^x</m> and many others.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be subsets of <m>\RR^n</m> and
          <m>\RR^m</m>, respectively. A <term>function</term> between
          linear spaces is a rule <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m>, which
          assigns to each <term>vector</term> in A a unique
          <term>vector</term> in <m>B</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We can define a function <m>f: \RR^3 \rightarrow \RR^3</m>
          by <m>f\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\z \end{pmatrix} =
          \begin{pmatrix}x^2\\y^2\\z^2 \end{pmatrix}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Another function <m>f: \RR^3 \rightarrow \RR^2</m> could be
          <m>f\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\z \end{pmatrix} =
          \begin{pmatrix}x-y\\z-y \end{pmatrix}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>linear function</term> or <term>linear
          transformation</term> from <m>\RR^n</m> to <m>\RR^m</m> is a
          function <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> such that for two
          vectors, <m>u,v \in \RR^n</m> and any scalar <m>a \in
          \RR</m>, the function must obey two rules.
          <md>
            <mrow>f(u+v) \amp  = f(u) + f(v)</mrow>
            <mrow>f(au) \amp  = af(u)</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Informally, we say that the function <term>respects</term>
          the two main operations on linear spaces: addition of
          vectors and multiplication by scalars. If we perform
          addition before or after the function, we get the same
          result. Likewise for scalar multiplication.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      By inspection and testing, one could determine that the first
      example above fails these two rules, but the second example
      satisfies them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This definition creates a restrictive but important class
      of linear functions. We could easily define linear algebra as a
      study of these transformations. There is an alternative and
      equivalent definition of a linear transformation.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> is linear if
          and only if it sends linear objects to linear objects.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      Under a linear transformation, points, lines, planes and etc. are changed
      to other points, lines, planes and etc. A line can't be bent into
      an arc or broken into two different lines. Hopefully, some of
      the major ideas of the course are starting to fit together: the
      two basic operations of addition and scalar multiplication give
      rise to spans, which are flat objects. Linear transformations
      preserve those operations, so they preserve flat objects.
      Exactly <em>how</em> they change these objects can be tricky to
      determine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, because of scalar multiplication, if we take <m>a =
      0</m> we get that <m>f(0) = 0</m>. Under a linear
      transformation, the origin is always sent to the origin. So, in
      addition to preserving flat objects, linear transformations can't
      move the origin. We could drop this condition of preserving the
      origin to get another class of functions.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An <term>affine transformation</term> from <m>\RR^n</m> to
          <m>\RR^m</m> is a transformation that preserves affine
          subspaces. These transformations preserve flat objects but
          may move the origin.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Though they are interesting, we don't spend much time with
      affine transformations. They can always be realized as a linear
      transformation combined with a shift or displacement of the
      entire space by a fixed vector. Since shifts are relatively
      simple, we can usually reduce problems of affine transformations
      to problems of linear transformations.

    <title>Composition</title>
    <p>
      Once we understood the functions of real numbers, we learned to
      compose them. We do the same for linear transformations.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f : \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> and <m>g: \RR^m
          \rightarrow \RR^l</m> be linear transformations. Then <m>g
          \circ f : \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^l</m> is the linear
          transformation formed by first applying <m>f</m> and then
          <m>g</m>. Note that the <m>\RR^m</m> has to match: <m>f</m>
          outputs to <m>\RR^m</m>, which is the input for <m>g</m>.
          Also note that the notation is written right-to-left: In
          <m>g \circ f</m>, the transformation <m>f</m> happens first,
          followed by <m>g</m>. This new transformation is called the
          <term>composition</term> of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.

    <title>Symmetry</title>
    <p>
      Notice that we've defined linear functions by the objects and/or
      properties they preserve. This is a very general technique in
      mathematics. Very frequently, functions are classified by what
      they preserve. As discussed in the very first chapter, we use
      the word <sq>symmetry</sq> to describe this perspective: the
      symmetries of a function are the objects or algebraic properties
      preserved by the function. A function exhibits more symmetry if
      it preserves more objects or more properties. The conventional
      use of symmetry in English relates more to a shape than a
      function: what are the symmetries of a hexagon?  We can connect
      the two ideas: asking for the symmetries of the hexagon can be
      thought of as asking for the transformations of <m>\RR^2</m>
      that preserve a hexagon. This is a bit of a reverse: the
      standard usage of the word talks about transformation as the
      symmetries of a shape. Here we start with a transformation and
      talk about the shape as a symmetry of the transformation: the
      hexagon is a symmetry of rotation by one-sixth of a full turn.
