    <title>Proving Some Properties of Linear Subspaces</title>
    <p>
      Throughout the course, I want to keep developing the idea of
      mathematical proof. I'll do two proofs using the material from
      this section of the course. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The intersection of any two linear subspaces is another
          linear subspace.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          A linear subspace is a subset of <m>\RR^n</m> with two
          properties: closed under vector addition and closed under
          scalar multiplication. If <m>L_1</m> and <m>L_2</m> are
          subspaces, I have to check that both properties hold
          for the intersection <m>L_1 \cap L_2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are in the
          intersection, then they are contained in both <m>L_1</m> and
          <m>L_2</m>. Since they are both in <m>L_1</m> and <m>L_1</m>
          is a subspace (meaning closed under vector addition), the
          sum <m>u + v</m> is also in <m>L_1</m>. The same is true for
          <m>L_2</m>. Therefore, the sum <m>u + v</m> is in both
          subspaces, thus in the intersection. Since I made no
          assumptions on the vectors, this shows the intersection is
          closed under vector addition.
        </p>
        <p>
          A very similar argument works for scalar multiplication. If
          a vector <m>u</m> is in the intersection (hence in both
          subspaces) and <m>a</m> is a scalar, then since each
          subspace is closed under scalar multiplication, the scalar
          multiple <m>au</m> is in both subspaces, hence in the
          intersection. This shows the intersection is closed under
          scalar multiplication.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        A hyperplane through the origin is a linear subspace.
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          I stated that loci were linear or affine subspaces and
          that loci through the origins were linear subspaces.
          However, I never proved this. Here, I'm going to prove it
          for the special case of a hyperplane.
        </p>
        <p> 
          A hyperplane is the locus of one linear equation.
          <me>
            a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \ldots a_nx_n = c 
          </me>
          However, if the hyperplane contains the origin, the constant
          <m>c</m> must be zero. (I stated this earlier; I could
          argue this by saying that if all the <m>x_i</m> are set to
          zero, the left side of the equation is zero, so the right
          side must also be zero). 
          <me>
            a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \ldots a_nx_n = 0 
          </me>
          All points on the hyperplane satisfy this equation, and I
          will use this fact to prove the proposition. To make this
          easier, I will write the equation in terms of dot products.
          If <m>n</m> is the vector with all the <m>a_i</m> (<m>n</m>
          for normal) and <m>x</m> is the vector with all the
          <m>x_i</m>, then the equation is 
          <me>
            n \cdot x = 0 
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> be vectors on the hyperplane,
          then <m>n \cdot u = 0</m> and <m>n \cdot v = 0</m>. Then I
          can consider 
          <me>
            n \cdot (u + v) 
          </me>.
          The dot product is linear, so it distributes here.
          <me>
            = n \cdot u + n \cdot v 
          </me>
          I just said that both of these dot products are zero, so
          the equation gives <m>0 + 0 = 0</m>. Therefore, <m>u + v</m>
          also satisfies the equation of the hyperplane, so is
          contained in the hyperplane.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do something very similar with the dot product to proof
          that the hyperplane is closed under scalar
          multiplication. If
          <m>a</m> is a scalar, consider the vector <m>au</m> to see
          if it satisfies the equation of the hyperplane. I start with
          the dot product with the normal. 
          <me>
            n \cdot (au)
          </me>
          By the properties of the dot product, again, I can pull out
          the scalar.
          <me>
            = a (n \cdot u)
          </me>
          Then I get <m>a(0)</m>, since <m>u</m> is on the hyperplane.
          This shows that the scalar multiple is also on the
          hyperplane.
        </p>
      </proof>
