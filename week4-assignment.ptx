        For each of the following systems of equations, write the
        corresponding matrix, solve the system by row-reduction, give
        the dimension of the solution space and write a description by
        parameters. Show the steps in your row-reductions. (20)

        How many linear equations do you need in <m>\RR^3</m> to lead
        to a matrix row that translates to <m>0=1</m> (hence a system
        with no solutions)? What is the maximum number of equations you
        can have in <m>\RR^3</m> and still have a unique solution?
        Answer both questions for <m>\RR^n</m> as well and give
        reasons for how you generalize the special case of three
        dimensions to the general case of <m>n</m> dimension. (6)
