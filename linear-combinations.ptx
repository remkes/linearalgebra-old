    <title>Writing Linear Combinations</title>
    <p>
      If <xref ref="section-week3-activity" />, I asked you to write
      some vectors as linear combinations of other vectors. In those
      calculations, you had to directly solve a system to find the
      correct coefficients for the linear combinations. In the present
      section, I want to return to that problem now that we have
      matrices and row reduction as tools. However, I also want to
      re-interpret the problem.

    <title>Bases for Spans</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="subsection-dimension-and-basis" />, we defined
      bases for linear subspaces; to recap, a basis is a linearly
      independent set of vector which span the subspace. Since the
      basis spans the subspace, any vector in the subspace can be
      written as a linear combination of the vectors in the basis. A
      basis gives us a way of describing a subspace.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>\{v_1, v_2, v_3\}</m> is a basis for a three-dimensional
      subspace in <m>\RR^</m>, then the vectors in this subspaces are
      precisely the all vectors of the form <m>av_1 + bv_2 + cv_3</m>
      where <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> are any real constant. To
      talk about a specific vector in a subspace, we need to specify
      the three constant. We can say that the vector is present <em>in
      terms of the basis</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me be more concrete and consider the vector
      <m>v = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}</m> in <m>\RR^4</m>. 
      We can express this as a linear combination of the standard
      basis.
      <me>
        v = 4 e_1 + 5 e_2
      </me>
      However, we can express <m>v</m> in any of the infinitely-many
      other bases of <m>\RR^2</m> as well. Here is one example.
      <me>
        v = 1 
        \begin{pmatrix}
          4 \\ 0 
        \end{pmatrix}
        - 1 
        \begin{pmatrix}
          0 \\ -5
        \end{pmatrix}
      </me>
      Here is yet another example.
      <me>
        v = \frac{9}{2} 
        \begin{pmatrix}
          1 \\ 1 
        \end{pmatrix}
        + \frac{1}{2} 
        \begin{pmatrix}
          -1 \\ 1
        \end{pmatrix}
      </me>
      The problem of finding an expression of a vector as a linear
      combination of other vectors is the problem of expression a
      vector in terms of a given basis. Depending on the situation,
      different bases for the same subspaces are often useful and we
      often want to change the presentation of vectors from one basis
      to another. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The subspace <m>\Span \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ -1
          \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -2 \\ 3\end{pmatrix}
          \right\}</m> is a plane in <m>\RR^3</m>. The vector <m>
          \begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ -4 \\ 7\end{pmatrix} </m> is a vector
          on this plane. Write this vector in terms of the given
          basis for the span.
        </p>
        <p>
          To do this, I need to find numbers <m>a</m> and
          <m>b</m> that satisfy 
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ -4 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} = a
            \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} + b
            \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll write each components of this vector equation
          seperately.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              -4 \amp  = -2a + 0b
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              -4 \amp  = a + (-2)b
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              7 \amp  = -1a + 3b
            </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a just a new linear system, with three equations and
          two variables, <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. I can solve it using
          matrices and row reduction. The matrix representing this
          system is
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{cc|c}
              -2 \amp 0 \amp -4 \\
              1 \amp -2 \amp -4 \\
              -1 \amp 3 \amp 7
            \end{array} \right) 
          </me>.
          This row reduces to 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{cc|c}
                1 \amp 0 \amp 2 \\
                0 \amp 1 \amp 3 \\
                0 \amp 0 \amp 0
            \end{array} \right) 
          </me>
          This is solvable and the solution is <m>a = 2</m> and
          <m>b=3</m>. This lets us write the vector in terms of the
          basis of the plane.
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ -4 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} = 2
            \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} + 3
            \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
          If the system wasn't solvable (if the last row of the matrix
          turned out to be equivalent to <m>0=1</m>, then the vector
          we started with wouldn't have been on the plane. Only
          vectors on the plane can be expressed in terms of the basis
          of the plane. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Take the basis <m>\left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \\ -1
          \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 0 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix},
          \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} \right\}</m> for
          <m>\RR^3</m>. 
          Express the vector <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2
          \end{pmatrix}</m> in terms of this basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          To do this, I need to find constants <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and
          <m>c</m> that solve
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = a
            \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} + b
            \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 0 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} + c
            \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Writen in components, this gives the following linear system.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              3a - 2b + 0c \amp  = 1
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              -a + 0b + 2c \amp  = 1
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              -a + 3b + 7c \amp  = 2
            </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          I translate this into a matrix.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c} 3 \amp -2 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
            -1 \amp 0 \amp 2 \amp 1 \\ -1 \amp 3 \amp 7 \amp 2
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          I row reduce this matrix to get the reduced row-echelon
          form.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ 0
            \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{1}{2} \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 1
            \amp \frac{1}{2} \end{array} \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          I conclude that <m>a=0</m>, <m>b=\frac{1}{2}</m> and <m>c =
          \frac{1}{2}</m>, which lets me write the vector in terms of
          the basis. 
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2\end{pmatrix} = 0
            \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} + \frac{1}{2}
            \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 0 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} + \frac{1}{2}
            \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} 
          </me>
