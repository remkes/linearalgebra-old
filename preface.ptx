    The content in this course is delivered mostly through a series
    of videos. For each of twelve weeks, there is a playlist of five
    to eight short videos. These notes serve as a record of the
    material in those videos, for review and reference. The notes
    are not written primarily to be a stand-alone text; it is
    assumed that you are also watching the videos.

    The class time that we have together is devoted to working
    through activities. In each week, there is an activity going
    through the material from the week. The solutions to the
    activities are included in the notes. However, the activities
    are intended for your active learning. You should give each
    activity a serious attempt before consulting with my solutions.

    In addition to the notes associated to each lecture, there are a
    number of other resources common to several mathematic courses.
    These includes information about assignment expecetations and
    acdemic honesty; a foruma sheet; a notation reference; and a
    library of function. All these material can be found <url

    In addition to the strictly mathematical material of the course,
    I will try to share some ideas which give perspective and
    context to mathematics. This include the philosophy of
    mathematics, the aesthetics of mathematics, and how our own
    worldview and assumptions influence mathematical thought.
    Linear algebra is perhaps the most abstract mathematical course
    offered at King's; at least, it offers the most oppotunity for
    abstract thinking. Therefore, I use this course as a venue for
    talking about abstraction in the context of perspectives and
    philosophy.
