      We can also specialize to transformations of <m>\RR^3</m>,
      though it is not as easy to give a complete account of the basic
      types  However, all of the types listed for <m>\RR^2</m>
      generalize.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Rotations in <m>\RR^3</m> are no longer about the origin.
            Instead, we have to choose an axis.  Any line through the
            origin will do for an axis of rotation.  Any rotation in
            <m>\RR^3</m> is determined by an axis of rotation and an
            angle of rotation about that axis.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Reflections are also altered: instead of reflecting over a
            line, we have to reflect over a plane through the origin.
            Any plane through the origin determines a reflection.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Skews are similarly defined: one or two directions are
            fixed and the remaining directions are tilted.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Dialations are also similar, though we have three possible
            axis directions in which to stretch or compress.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Like <m>\RR^2</m>, we can project onto the origin, sending
            everything to zero, or onto a line, sending every point to
            the closest point on a line. Examples include projection
            onto the axes. However, we can also project onto planes.
            Sending <m>(a,b,c)</m> to <m>(a,b,0)</m>, for example,
            removes the <m>z</m> coordinate; this is projection onto
            the <m>xy</m> plane.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      In addition, other types of transformations exist. One example
      is the reflection through the origin: this transformation
      multiplies all vectors by <m>(-1)</m>, sending them to the
      opposite point on the other side of the origin. In <m>\RR^2</m>,
      this turned out to be the same as the rotation by half a turn.
      However, in <m>\RR^3</m>, this is neither a rotation nor a
      reflection.
