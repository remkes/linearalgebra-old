          We need to determine if there are any redundancies in the
          span. To do this, we put the vectors in the span as
          <emph>rows</emph> of a matrix.

          We row reduce this matrix. We either row reduce without
          interchanging rows or keeping track of row exchanges. (If
          done by computer, as is our practice, we'll have to be
          careful choosing a basis. Because of this, I'll recheck the
          bases after I find them.)

              1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{13}{3} \\

          Every row that has a leading one is a row that is necessary
          for the span; every row without a leading one is redundant.
          Here, there is one vector that is redundant, since we have a
          row of zeros. There are two leading ones, so the dimension of
          this span is 2. We can take the vectors that corresponded
          to rows with leading ones as a basis.

        We can check with a matrix that these four are independent
        using the same steps as before (I've not shown that work). We
        need this check to make sure rows weren't exchanged during row
        reduction.

          Every row that has a leading one is a row that is necessary

          Here, the fourth vector is all zeros, so there is a
          redundant vector. There are three
          leading ones, so the dimension of this span is 3.

          Every row that has a leading one is a row that is necessary

          We see that we have a row of zeros, so one vector is
          redundant. There are three leading ones, so the dimension of
          this span is 3. We can take the vectors that corresponded to
          rows with leading ones as a basis.

          If we check, however, we find that this is still redundant.
          This is not a basis, so one of these rows must have been
          redundant and the row reduction must have involved some
          exchange of rows. If we take the fourth vector instead of
          the third, we get this basis.
