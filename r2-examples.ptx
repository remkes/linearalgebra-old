    <title>Five Types</title>
    <p>
      It is useful for us to specialize the transformations <m>\RR^2
      \rightarrow \RR^2</m>, in order to build experience and
      intuition. As we noted above, linear transformations preserve
      flat objects. What can we do to <m>\RR^2</m> that preserves
      lines and preserves the origin?
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          There are five basic types of linear transformation of
          <m>\RR^2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Rotations</em> about the origin (either clockwise or
          counter-clockwise) preserve lines. We can't rotate around
          any other point since that would move the origin. Since we
          can choose any angle, there are infinitely many such
          rotations. Also, since rotating by <m>\theta</m> radians
          clockwise is the same as <m>2\pi - \theta</m> radians
          counter-clockwise, we typically choose to only deal with
          counter-clockwise rotations. Counter-clockwise rotations
          are considered positive and clockwise rotations are
          considered negative.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Reflections</em> over lines through the origin preserve
          lines. The line of reflection must passthrough the origin
          or else the reflection will move the origin. Since there
          are infinitely many different lines through the origin,
          there are infinitely many such reflections.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Skews</em> are a little trickier to visualize. A skew is
          a transformation that takes either vertical or horizontal
          lines (but not both) and tilts them diagonally. It changes
          squares into parallelograms. The tilted lines are still
          lines, so it is a linear transformation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Dilations</em> are transformations which stretch or
          shink in various directions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Projections</em> are transformations that collapse
          <m>\RR^2</m> down to a line through the origin. Two
          important examples are projection onto either axis.
          Projection onto the <m>x</m> axis sends a point <m>(a,b)</m>
          to <m>(a,0)</m>, removing the <m>y</m> component  Likewise,
          projection onto the <m>y</m> axis sends a point <m>(a,b)</m>
          to <m>(0,b)</m>, removing the <m>x</m> component  In a
          similar manner, we can project onto any line through the
          origin by sending each point to the closest point on the
          line. Finally, there is the projection to the origin which
          sends all points to the origin.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We present the following interesting theorem without proof.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          All linear transformations of <m>\RR^2</m> are generated by
          the composition of transformations of the previous five types.
        </p>
      </statement>

    <title>Matrices of the Five Types</title>
    <p>
      The rotation in <m>\RR^2</m> by the angle <m>\theta</m>
      (counter-clockwise) around the origin given by the matrix
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix}
          \cos \theta \amp - \sin \theta \\
          \sin \theta \amp \cos \theta
        \end{pmatrix}
      </me>.
      Following this formula, a quarter turn is 
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix}
          0 \amp -1 \\
          1 \amp 0 
        \end{pmatrix}
      </me>.
      Likewise, a half turn is 
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix}
          -1 \amp 0 \\
          0 \amp -1 
        \end{pmatrix}
      </me>.
      Finally, a three-quarter turn is 
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix}
          0 \amp 1 \\
          -1 \amp 0 
        \end{pmatrix}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}</m> is a
      <em>unit</em> vector in <m>\RR^2</m>, then the reflection over
      the line in the direction of <m>\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b
      \end{pmatrix}</m> is given by the matrix
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix}
          a^2 - b^2 \amp 2ab \\
          2ab \amp b^2 - a^2
        \end{pmatrix}
      </me>
      For some examples, reflection over the <m>x</m> axis is 
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix}
          1 \amp 0 \\
          0 \amp -1 
        \end{pmatrix}
      </me>.
      Reflection over the <m>y</m> axis is 
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix}
          - 1 \amp 0 \\
          0 \amp 1 
        \end{pmatrix}
      </me>.
      Reflection over the the line <m>y=x</m> is
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix}
          0 \amp 1 \\
          1 \amp 0 
        \end{pmatrix}
      </me>.
      Reflection over the line <m>y=-x</m> is 
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix}
          0 \amp -1 \\
          -1 \amp 0 
        \end{pmatrix}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There isn't necessarily an easily describable form for all
      skews. However, we can give some examples. A horizontal skew
      that moves the positive <m>y</m> axis in the positive <m>x</m>
      direction is
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix}
          1 \amp 0 \\
          1 \amp 1 
        \end{pmatrix}
      </me>.
      Similarly, a skew in the positive <m>y</m> direction is 
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix}
          1 \amp 1 \\
          0 \amp 1 
        \end{pmatrix}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dialations have two stretch factors: <m>a</m> in the <m>x</m>
      direction and <m>b</m> in the <m>y</m> direction. The matrix for
      this is 
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix}
          a \amp 0 \\
          0 \amp b 
        \end{pmatrix}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, let <m>\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}</m> be a
      <em>unit</em> vector. The projection only to line in the
      direction of this unit vector is given by the matrix
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix}
          a^2 \amp ab \\
          ab \amp b^2 
        \end{pmatrix}
      </me>.
      In addition, there is one other projection: the projection to
      the origin. This sends everything to zero and its matrix is the
      zero matrix.
