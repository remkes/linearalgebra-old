    <title>General Properties of the Matrix Action</title>
    <p>
      I have defined linear transformations. At this point, I could
      state and try to prove a variety of properties about linear
      transformations and their matrix representations. Most
      obviously, perhaps, I could prove that the matrix action is
      actually a linear transformation, as I stated in <xref
      ref="section-matrices-and-transformations" />, and the converse
      that all linear transformations can be represented as matrices.
      I could also prove the two properties in <xref
      ref="proposition-matrix-multiplication" />. I am opting not to
      present these general proofs. They are not conceptually
      difficult, but to do them, in general, is notationally
      difficult.  It involves a lot of matrix coefficients, vector
      coefficients and many subscripts. To include those proofs wasn't
      useful for building up experience with proofs (other than
      perhaps to show that notation is a major challenge in writing
      mathematical proof).

    <title>Properties of Transformations in <m>\RR^2</m></title>
    <p>
      Instead of proving the most general statements about matrix
      transformations, I'll prove some more specific statements about
      the types of transformations I defined in <xref
      ref="section-r2-examples" />. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        Any two rotations in <m>\RR^2</m> commute. 
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          To commute means that if the order of the composition (or
          matrix multiplication) is reversed, the outcome is the same.
          That is, if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are the matrix
          representations of two rotations, then <m>AB = BA</m> is a
          true statement about matrix multiplication. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I want my proof to be completely general, so I want to work
          with arbitrary rotations. Let's say that <m>A</m> is a
          rotation by the angle <m>\theta</m>, so it has the matrix
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix}
              \cos \theta \amp - \sin \theta \\
              \sin \theta \amp \cos \theta
            \end{pmatrix}
          </me>.
          Let's also say that <m>B</m> is a rotation by the angle
          <m>\phi</m>, so it has the matrix
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix}
              \cos \phi \amp - \sin \phi \\
              \sin \phi \amp \cos \phi
            \end{pmatrix}
          </me>.
          Now I need to calculate the two matrix multiplications and
          show that the result is the same regardless of the order.
          First I will calculate <m>AB</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              AB \amp = \begin{pmatrix}
                \cos \theta \amp - \sin \theta \\
                \sin \theta \amp \cos \theta
              \end{pmatrix}
              \begin{pmatrix}
                \cos \phi \amp - \sin \phi \\
                \sin \phi \amp \cos \phi
              \end{pmatrix} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \begin{pmatrix}
                \cos \theta \cos \phi - \sin \theta \sin \phi \amp 
                -\cos \theta \sin \phi - \sin \theta \cos \phi \\ 
                \sin \theta \cos \phi + \cos \theta \sin \phi \amp 
                -\sin \theta \sin \phi + \cos \theta \cos \phi 
              \end{pmatrix} 
            </mrow>
          </md>.
          Now I'll do the other order of the multiplication.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              BA \amp = \begin{pmatrix}
                \cos \phi \amp - \sin \phi \\
                \sin \phi \amp \cos \phi
              \end{pmatrix}
              \begin{pmatrix}
                \cos \theta \amp - \sin \theta \\
                \sin \theta \amp \cos \theta
              \end{pmatrix} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \begin{pmatrix}
                \cos \phi \cos \theta - \sin \phi \sin \theta \amp 
                - \cos \phi \sin \theta - \sin \phi \cos \theta \\ 
                \sin \phi \cos \theta + \cos \phi \sin \theta \amp 
                -\sin \phi \sin \theta + \cos \phi \cos \theta
              \end{pmatrix} 
            </mrow>
          </md>.
          I  can take this second result and switch the order of all the
          multiplications (which is valid since these are just
          multiplications of ordinary numbers). I can also reorder a
          couple of the additions/subtractions.
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix}
              \cos \theta \cos \phi - \sin \theta \sin \phi \amp 
              - \cos \theta \sin \phi - \sin \theta \cos \phi \\ 
              \sin \theta \cos \phi + \cos \theta \sin \phi \amp 
              -\sin \theta \sin \phi + \cos \theta \cos \phi
            \end{pmatrix} 
          </me>.
          This is the same as the result of <m>AB</m>. This concludes
          the proof, showing that the outcome of either order of
          matrix multiplication is the same.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      You might wonder, at this point, about the structure of this
      proof. I've tried to say several times that to prove an
      equality, I need to start at one side and end at the other.
      However, here I've tried to prove <m>AB=BA</m> and done so by
      reducing to a common form. Am I disobeying my own rules?
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not contradicting myself, though it is a very good
      question. To understand why look at the statement of the
      proposition. The composition of the transformation is a process where
      two transformations combine into one new one. There are two ways
      to do this: <m>AB</m> or <m>BA</m>. The proposition says that the
      outcome of both orders is the same. Therefore, I can calculate
      the outcome of both orders and compare them. This is different
      from a proposition that simply states an equation; for these
      propositions, reducing each side of the equation to a common
      expression can result in a false proof (for example, by
      multiplying both sides by zero). Here, I'm not reducing an
      equation to a common form but doing two processes and comparing
      the result. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        Prove that a projection in <m>\RR^2</m> composed with itself
        is just the same projection. (That is, for any projection
        <m>A</m>, <m>AA = A</m>.) 
      </statement>
      <proof>
        All I need to do for this proof is take the general matrix
        for a projection and multiply it by itself. The general matrix
        is
        <me>
          A = \begin{pmatrix}
            a^2 \amp ab \\
            ab \amp b^2 
          \end{pmatrix} 
        </me>,
        remembering that the vector defining the line is a unit vector
        direction. Since it is a unit vector direction, I know that
        <m>a^2 + b^2 = 1</m>, which I will need for this proof. Now
        I'll take this matrix and multiply it by itself.
        <me>
          A^2 = \begin{pmatrix}
            a^2 \amp ab \\
            ab \amp b^2 
          \end{pmatrix} 
          \begin{pmatrix}
            a^2 \amp ab \\
            ab \amp b^2 
          \end{pmatrix}  =
          \begin{pmatrix}
            (a^2)(a^2) + (ab)(ab) \amp 
            (a^2)(ab) + (ab)(b^2) \\
            (ab)(a^2) + (b^2)(ab) \amp
            (ab)(ab) + (b^2)(b^2)
          \end{pmatrix}
        </me>
        In each component of this matrix, I can factor out <m>a^2</m>,
        <m>b^2</m>, or <m>ab</m>. 
        <me>
          = \begin{pmatrix}
            a^2(a^2 + b^2) \amp 
            ab(a^2 + b^2) \\
            ab(a^2 + b^2) \amp
            b^2(a^2 + b^2)
          \end{pmatrix}
        </me>
        Then I can use the fact that <m>a^2 + b^2 = 1</m>.
        <me>
          = \begin{pmatrix}
            a^2 \amp ab \\ 
            ab \amp b^2 
          \end{pmatrix} = A 
        </me>
        This is the same as the starting matrix. I've proved that
        <m>AA=A</m>, which was the goal of the proposition.
      </proof>
    </proposition>
