    <title>Transformations of Spans</title>
    <p>
      Now that I understand how matrices describe transformations, I want
      to know how transformations affect linear subspaces. I know
      that they preserve them (and each linear subspace is sent to
      some other linear subspace), but I want to be more specific: given
      a particular linear subspace, can I determine exactly where it
      goes under a transformation?
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>M: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> is a transformation
          (represented by a <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>M</m>) and
          <m>L</m> is a linear or affine subspace of <m>\RR^n</m>,
          then the result of the matrix <m>M</m> acting on all vectors
          in <m>L</m> will be a linear or affine subspace of
          <m>\RR^m</m> called the <term>image of <m>L</m> under
          <m>M</m></term>. The image of all of <m>\RR^n</m> under
          <m>M</m> is simply called the <term>image of
          <m>M</m></term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The most important property of linear transformations is that
      they preserve addition and scalar multiplication. That means
      they preserve the linear combinations. Let <m>a_i</m> be
      scalars and <m>v_i</m> be vectors in <m>\RR^n</m>, with <m>M</m>
      a <m>m\times n</m> matrix. 
      <md> 
        <mrow>
          M(a_1 v_1 + a_2v_2 + \ldots + a_kv_k) \amp = M(a_1v_1) +
          M(a_2v_2) + \ldots + M(a_kv_k)
        </mrow> 
        <mrow>
          \amp = a_1(Mv_1) + a_2(Mv_2) + \ldots + a_k (Mv_k)
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      This calculation shows that the image of a linear combination is
      still a linear combination, just in the vectors <m>Mv_i</m>
      instead of <m>v_i</m>. Since all elements of a span are linear
      combinations, everything in the span of the <m>v_i</m> is sent
      to the span of the vectors <m>Mv_i</m>. I can summarize these
      observations in a proposition.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A linear transformation represented by a <m>m \times n</m>
          matrix <m>M</m> sends spans to spans. In particular, the
          span <m>\Span \{ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k\}</m> is sent to
          <m>\Span \{ Mv_1, Mv_2, \ldots, Mv_k\}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      Matrices acting on spans are easy: I just figure out where the
      individual vectors go and the span of those vectors will be
      transformed into the span of their images. Offset spans are
      almost as easy: consider an affine subspace <m>u + \Span \{ v_1,
      v_2, \ldots, v_k\}</m>. Any element of this looks like <m>u +
      a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + \ldots a_kv_k</m>. I can calculate where this
      linear combination goes under the action of <m>M</m>. 
      <me>
        M(u + a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + \ldots + a_kv_k) = Mu + a_1 Mv_1 +
        a_2Mv_2 + \ldots + a_kMv_k
      </me>
      The offset span is still sent to an offset span, with offset
      <m>Mu</m> and spanning vectors <m>Mv_i</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be careful that the matrix need not preserve the dimension of
      the span. Even if the <m>v_i</m> are linearly independent and
      form a basis for the span, the vectors <m>Mv_i</m> may not be
      linearly independent. The dimension of the new span might be
      smaller. Linear combinations are sent to linear combinations,
      but linear independence may not be preserved.

    <title>Transformation of Loci</title>
    <p>
      For loci, the picture is much more complicated. Equations do
      not transform nearly as pleasantly as spans. Planes in
      <m>\RR^3</m> are defined by a normal; I might hope that the new
      plane is defined by the image of the normal. Unfortunately,
      since the matrix may not preserve orthogonality, this will
      usually not happen. To determine the image of a locus, the best
      approach is to describe the locus as a span or offset span to
      find the image of that span.
