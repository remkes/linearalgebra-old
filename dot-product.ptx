    <title>Definition</title>
    <p>
      Earlier, I said that I couldn't multiply two vectors together.
      That's mostly true: there is no general product of two vectors
      <m>uv</m>, which is still a vector, as least none that has any
      useful or reasonable geometric meaning.  However, there are
      other kinds of <sq>multiplication</sq> which combine two
      vectors. The operation defined in this lecture multiplies two
      vectors, but the result is a scalar.

        <p>
          The <term>dot product</term> or <term>inner product</term>
          or <term>scalar product</term> of two vectors <m>u</m> and
          <m>v</m> is given by the following formula.
          <me>
            u \cdot v = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n
            \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots
            \\ v_n \end{pmatrix} = u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2 + \ldots + u_n
            v_n
          </me>

      </statement>

      I can think of the dot product as a scalar measure of the
      similarity of direction between the two vectors. If the two
      vectors point in a similar direction, their dot product is
      large, but if they point in very different directions, their dot
      product is small. This is a bit strange, since there already is
      a measure, at least in <m>\RR^2</m>, of this difference: the
      angle between two vectors. Thankfully, the two measures of
      difference agree, and the dot product can be expressed in terms
      of angles.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>angle</term> <m>\theta</m> between two non-zero
          vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is given by
          the follow equation.
          <me>
            \cos \theta = \frac{u \cdot v}{|u||v|}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      This definition agrees with the angles in <m>\RR^2</m> and
      <m>\RR^3</m>, which I can visualize. However, this serves as a
      new <em>definition</em> for angles between vectors in all
      <m>\RR^n</m> when <m>n \geq 4</m>. Since I can't visualize those
      spaces, I don't have a way of drawing angles and calculating
      them with conventional trigonometry. This definition allows me
      to extend angles in a completely algebraic way. Notes that
      this angle <m>\theta \in [0, \pi]</m>, since I can always choose
      the smallest possible angle between two vectors. This means that
      the inverse cosine is unique for this calculation. 
    </p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> are called
          <term>orthogonal</term> or <term>perpendicular</term> or
          <term>normal</term> if <m>u \cdot v = 0</m>.

    <title>Properties of the Dot Product</title>
    <p>
      There are many pairs of orthogonal vectors. Thinking of the dot
      product as a multiplication, I have uncovered a serious
      difference between the dot product and the conventional
      multiplication of numbers. If <m>a,b\in \RR</m>, then
      <m>ab=0</m> implies that one of <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> must be
      zero. For vectors, it can be true that <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0
      \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} 
      = 0</m> even though neither factor in the product is the zero
      vector. Here is a definition to keep track of this new
      property.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Assume <m>A</m> is a set with addition and some kind of
          multiplication. Also assume that <m>0 \in A</m>. If <m>u
          \neq 0</m> and <m>v \neq 0</m> but <m>uv =0</m>, then
          <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are called <term>zero
          divisors</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      An important property of ordinary numbers, as I just noted, is
      that there are no zero divisors. Other algebraic structures,
      such as vectors with the dot product, may have many zero
      divisors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that I have defined a new operation, it is useful to see how
      it interacts with previously defined structures. I'll take up
      the proofs of these in <xref ref="section-proofs-week2" /> and
      in the activity for this week.

      In <m>\RR^2</m>, norms and dot products allow me to recreate
      some well-known geometric constructions. For example, now that
      I have defined lengths and angles, I can state the cosine law in
      terms of vectors. The visualization of the vector relationships
      of the cosine law is shown in <xref ref="figure-the-cosine-law"
      />.

        <p>
          Let <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> be vectors in <m>\RR^n</m>.
          <me>
            |u-v|^2 = |u|^2 + |v|^2 - 2|u||v| \cos \theta = |u|^2 +
            |v|^2 - 2 u \cdot v
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          To prove the cosine law using vectors, I'm going to interpret the
          left side, <m>|u-v|^2</m>, as <m>(u-v) \cdot (u-v)</m>, using
          the second identity in <xref
          ref="proposition-dot-product-properties" />. Then I can go
          through some algebraic manipulation with the dot product.
          First, I'll distribute the dot product.
           <me>
            |u-v|^2 = (u-v) \cdot (u-v) = u \cdot u - v \cdot u - u \cdot
            v + v \cdot v
          </me>
          Then I can interchange the order of the second term, since the
          dot product is commutative.
          <me>
            |u-v|^2 = u \cdot u - u \cdot v - u \cdot v + v \cdot v
          </me>
          Then I can group the middle terms.
          <me>
            |u-v|^2 = u \cdot u - 2u \cdot v + v \cdot v
          </me>
          Then I can interpret the first and last terms as length squared. 
          <me>
            |u-v|^2 = |u|^2 - 2u \cdot v + |v|^2 
          </me>
          Then I can reorder the terms.
          <me>
            |u-v|^2 = |u|^2 + |v|^2 - 2u \cdot v 
          </me>
          Finally, using the definition of angle, I can replace the dot
          product with <m>|u||v| \cos \theta</m>, where <m>\theta</m> is
          the angle between the two vectors. 
          <me>
            |u-v|^2 = |u|^2 + |v|^2 - 2|u||v| \cos \theta
          </me>
          This is the cosine law.
