        Find the (real) eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this
        matrices. Feel free to use a computer for the row reductions
        and for the roots of the complicated polynomials, but make
        sure you clearly indicate all the steps in the process. When
        there are square root, give you answer in exact values (that
        is, in terms of square roots, not decimal expansions.) (6)

        What are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a dialation
        matrix in <m>\RR^n</m>? (In particular, consider the special
        case where several of the dialation coefficients are the same.
